He is a driven and irritable young man, consumed by a desire to ensure his own future and free himself of the influence of his family, whom he resents for favoring his brothers over him. Consequently, he has no time for pointless distractions or paying attention to other people's problems.</p>
<p>As it happens, time is something he is about to get plenty of. On the eve of the Cyoria's annual summer festival, he is killed and brought back to the beginning of the month, just before he was about to take a train to Cyoria. Suddenly trapped in a time loop with no clear end or exit, Zorian will have to look both within and without to unravel the mystery before him. And he does have to unravel it, for the time loop hadn't been made for his sake and dangers lurk everywhere...</p>
<p>Repetition is the mother of learning, but Zorian will have to first make sure he survives to try again - in a world of magic, even a time traveler isn't safe from those who wish him ill.</p>

<p><strong>Book Three Stubs November 8th (Chapter 85 - Chapter 118)</strong></p>
<p>Could you survive a horror movie?</p>
<p>That's the question Riley must answer after he and his friends get lured to Carousel, a malevolent town where horror movies come to life.</p>
<p>Riley thinks he is in big trouble when he is assigned the Film Buff archetype, a minor support class that has a penchant for dying early in movies. At first resigned to his fate to die over and over, he believes he has found a way to survive. Upon obtaining the Oblivious Bystander trope, monsters and killers will not harm him as long as he can convincingly pretend he has not noticed them. At first, this ability appears to be a joke, but Riley thinks that with some clever exploitation, it might just be his greatest strength.</p>
<p>What to expect:</p>
<p>-Strategic gameplay and clever uses of movie tropes to survive</p>
<p>-Perilous storylines right from your favorite horror movies</p>
<p>-Creative Twists of Classic Horror Movie tropes</p>
<p>-Moderate stats-based combat and strategy</p>

<p><strong>Book I: Lost Things</strong></p>
<p><span>Tristan Abrascal is a thief, one of many making their living under the perpetual twilight of the greatest city in all of Vesper. Quick wit and a contract with a capricious goddess have always kept him one step ahead, until one night he crosses a line by accident that burns all the bridges he had left. But not all is lost, as his mentor offers a way out of peril that turns out to be more than a simple escape. </span></p>
<p><span>It is also an opportunity to get even with the <em>infanzones</em>, the nobles he’s lived under all his life, and it so happens that Tristan has a full ledger’s worth of scores to settle with them.</span></p>
<p><span>Lady Angharad Tredegar has fled halfway across the world, leaving behind a ruin of a life: her family butchered by a ruthless enemy, their estate torched and their nobility revoked. Yet no matter how far she flees the blades of assassins follow, and she finds herself growing desperate for any protection. She has one relative left to call on, her estranged uncle, but she finds that the safety he offers comes at a cost. </span></p>
<p><span>Angharad has sworn revenge, however, and her honour will allow for no compromise. She will do what she must to survive so that one day bloody vengeance can be visited upon her enemies.</span></p>
<p><span>The paths of the two take them to the doorstep of the Watch, but for desperate souls like them enrolment is a lost cause. They will have to do it the hard way instead, by surviving the trials on the isle known as the Dominion of Lost Things. </span></p>
<p><span>Where every year many go, and few return.</span></p>
<p><strong>Book II: Good Treasons</strong></p>
<p>The trials of the Dominion are over.</p>
<p>The four survivors have become students of Scholomance, enrolling together as a cabal, yet even on those infamous grounds they soon learn none are beyond the reach of their pasts.</p>
<p>Angharad Tredegar is returned to a semblance of the world she left behind, but finds her honor sorely tested by bargains offered - every bit as tempting as in the stories and even deadlier.</p>
<p>Tristan Abrascal needs answers. Mysterious enemies keep trying to abduct him, his classroom does not exist and he’s now had several conversations with dead people. Worst of all, his carrots keep dying.</p>
<p>Maryam Khaimov is going mad, which would worry her less if it were happening on schedule. More frightening yet is the possibility that she is not, and there truly <em>is </em>someone else going around wearing her face.</p>
<p>Song Ren must forge the others into a functional unit, all the while fending off enemies on all sides: rival cabals, vengeful countrymen and the deluge of implacable foes her companions simply cannot seem to stop attracting.</p>
<p>Failure is not an option, for Song must bring back honor to her family’s name whatever the cost: it is the only way to keep their disgrace from literally eating them all alive.</p>
<p>And as the four chase shadows in Scholomance, in the distance looms the greater test awaiting them in the Asphodel Rectorate. Asphodel is a faded power, the rotten carcass of what it once was, but under that rot looms darker things - of which monsters might just be the least dangerous.</p>
<p>Besides, is treason really such an evil when you have the best of reasons for it?</p>

But in a land ruled by magical families, no one welcomes the possibility of a dangerous new player.

<p>If the most powerful people in the world wish to kill the ninth-born, they will have to find him or her first. And that's not going to be easy when the Orellens have called upon dark magic to create hundreds of heirs. The boys and girls are given new bodies, new names, and even new magical talents before they are scattered across the continent. Only one among them is the real ninth, but all of them will have to grow up in a world where they are fugitives.</p>

<p><strong>BOOK 1 COMPLETED! </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The long path starts here. A journey through lands haunted by demons, fae, and the ghosts of the past. </strong></p>
<p>For decades, the lands of Aurum lived in fear beneath the threat of the wicked White Queen. <span>A cruel sorceress, she worked the Art of magic to bring down freezing blizzards and ruin upon those who opposed her. Her mad ambition swallowed an entire generation in flame and horror, and it seemed that all would be swept up in the bloody tyranny of her rule.</span></p>
<p><span>For a time. </span></p>
<p><span>That's all in the past, now. </span><span>Years back, the White Queen was slain, her ambitions broken, her erstwhile kingdom shattered. The bones of her kinsmen scattered into the earth, so much dust, all for naught. </span><span>So it goes. </span></p>
<p><span>Though the Queen's War is nothing but a memory now, the lands are tired, broken, bled dry. Charred ruins lie where bustling towns once stood, and quiet shadows settle where folk made their homes, their lives, not so long ago. Where humanity has retreated, dark powers such as fae and demons have crept forth. Even the gods seem exhausted. Some wonder if things will ever be right again. </span></p>
<p>It is into these scarred and shattered lands that the young wizard Martimeos, now of age, takes his first steps. Such is the nature of the Art; those it embraces are driven forth to wander, to see the lands, no matter the darkness that lies across their path. But unlike most, he has a goal: His older brother left to fight against the White Queen, but never returned, leaving behind only tales of what he had done. Martimeos does not hold onto the hope that his brother may live, or even that he'll find his bones, but to learn of what happened to him, to his friends? That is worth knowing.</p>
<p>And so he follows a fading trail, chasing echoes of the past and haunted by his memories of the war's horror. It will be a long journey, and along the way Martimeos will uncover secrets, tales of his brother's heroism and deeds. He will begin to wonder what sort of man his brother was, and whether or not the war had changed him. In time, these questions will carry him west, far west; deep into the mysteries of the Art and the world itself. Fortune has its plans for Martimeos, and those who would travel with him - whether he would like it or not. </p>
<p>But it all starts here, in a dark forest, and a chance meeting with the mysterious swamp-witch, Elyse, whose easy smiles and charm hide secrets darker than Martimeos suspects. Here, with a quiet shade from his past that haunts him, and strange, cruel thorns that choke the land and his very dreams. Here, with the cursed village of Silverfish, and its tale of woe, and the regrets and sorrows of its folk, with demons and defeated men and a tragedy that has gone on for far, far too long. The world as it once was might never return, but there is always the choice: to do what one can to make it better, or settle into the shadow yourself.  </p>
<p>The Art will snare you and Fortune cast you to the wind to tell the tale it wants. Come along and see how it begins.</p>
<p>Wander west with us, if you would. </p>
<p><strong>WANDER WEST, IN SHADOW </strong>is a slow-paced, classic adventure tale that takes place in a dark fantasy world of faded kingdoms and lost history, with no litrpg elements. Magic in this setting is less powerful than in many other fictions, especially when Elyse and Martimeos are first starting out their journey: discretion is the better part of valor, and it is often better to run than it is to stand and fight.</p>

<p>In a world of lightless skies and endless secrets, humanity is a vigil of light against the eternal darkness.  Under the imprimatur of the Illuminated King and the nefarious endorsement of the Reflected Council, a veteran explorer assembles an expedition to the far east.  A place that no sane and god-fearing man would ever go.</p>
<p>Jonathan Heights will, and must, for he claims to have seen sunlight.  A laughable myth and fairy tale, but he will not be stopped on his journey to find it again.</p>
<p>Wonders and horrors both lie between the human lands and his ultimate goal; things long-forgotten and long-dead, that which could not be recorded on any map.  They are temptation and terror to the wise and foolish alike, but not to Jonathan. His purpose is clear, and he has but one goal, yet the truth is shrouded and motives remain uncertain among the agents of both crown and underworld as they join Jonathan aboard the airship Endeavor to sail the strange and exotic lands out there in the darkness.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Chasing Sunlight is a pulp airship adventure serial inspired by Sunless Sea, HP Lovecraft, and a little bit of Moby Dick and The Odyssey.  It will be a single book, somewhere between 25 and 30 chapters.  </p>
<p>The first five chapters will be uploaded once a day, Mon 28 - Fri 1, at which point it will be uploaded every Friday at 5PM.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">- The MC begins the story as a child.  As she grows up, she will have relationships that I intend to be appropriate for her stages of life, BUT THERE WILL BE NO SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS UNTIL SHE IS AN ADULT.  Expect eventual teenage drama progressing into more adult relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">- MC is an adult equivalent to age 18 as the end of Chapter 69/beginning of Chapter 70.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">- There is action, but it is not constant action, and it will again be appropriate for the MCs development.  As a child, she will be challenged by child things, and as she grows into power the scale of threats will increase.</span></p>

<p>When the System came to Earth, technology failed, monsters appeared, and billions died as humans were inducted into the game-like physics the System enforced. </p>
<p>Unfortunately for the System, not all humans were on Earth.  Some scattered postbiological individuals decided to push it back, and embarked on a decade-long crusade to eliminate the System from Earth.</p>
<p>Cato is just an ordinary postbiological citizen, disgusted enough by the System’s excesses to go through one of the portals on Earth and spread himself to the broader System just as Earth is completely freed.  He has no magic, for the System can’t be destroyed from within, but he does have the technology and knowledge of a civilization that is reaching toward the second rank of the Kardashev scale.  Cato may have to operate under the System’s limitations, but he certainly doesn’t have to play by its rules, and fully intends to remove the threat it offers.</p>
<p><em>“…furthermore, I maintain that the System must be destroyed.”</em></p>
<p><em>***</em></p>
<p>Book 2: Undermining the System</p>
<p>Spreading into the wider System, Cato is confronted with the full scope of his crusade.  Tens of thousands of worlds or more, beings capable of destroying planets, and even stricter limitations on technology if he doesn’t want to show is hand early.</p>
<p>All he has are his two agents and a few dubious allies.  If he were a being of flesh and blood, forced to go planet by planet in a slow march from one end of the System to the other, it would be the work of thousands or millions of years.  But Cato is of Sol, a postbiological citizen with no such restrictions, and he can move in ways that no conventional human could.</p>
<p>The System may be immense, and the people within it have powers impossible to a technological civilization, but Cato has exponential growth.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Book 3: Crashing the System</p>
<p>In the years since the Annexation War, Cato has quietly spread throughout the System, watching, waiting, and building his forces.  When the Sydean Lineage returns, he finally has a line to the Core, and once he can deal with the System Core, he bring down the System for good.</p>
<p>Of course, it isn’t so simple.  The System-gods are aware of him now, powerful and ancient forces waiting to pounce on any mistake — and perfectly willing to murder millions of innocents for even a perceived injury against him.  Cast as a monster to the denizens of the System, Cato has to bribe, intimidate, or convince anyone he can to be on his side instead, because the goal is still simple and clear.</p>
<p>He has to crash the System.</p>

<p>Engineer, double amputee, and now astronaut for NuEarth LLC. Chris is about to complete his life-long dream of being the first man to moonwalk on prosthetics. At least until his rocket explodes on launch.</p>
<p>That should have been harder to walk off than losing both his legs, but instead he finds himself in a new world and a new body - one that's three feet tall, covered in blue fur, and has the ability to command the absolute loyalty of any goblin he meets. Removed from everyone he's ever known, the one familiar element to this new planet is that it's got a moon, too. A big one, with forests and seas. And Chris sees no reason why a little something like death and reincarnation should get in the way of his goal.</p>
<p>Armed with an expanding army of fanatical followers and a dubious, self-propagating 'Goblin Tech Tree' managed by an enigmatic system with its own motivations, he'll stop at nothing to jump-start the Apollo program fly to the moon. But he was brought to the new world for a reason, and not everyone is content to leave the goblin king to his own devices. Chris will have to keep his tribe alive and growing through if he hopes to complete his derailed moon mission and solve the mystery of his second life.</p>

<p><i>The Best Defense</i><span> is a science fiction web serial in the HFY subgenre -- a story niche that, first and foremost, describes humans being awesome because they are human. You can expect: </span></p>
<p><span>- Multiple POVs, including humans, aliens, and AI characters.</span></p>
<p><span>- Significant near-future space exploration concepts.</span></p>
<p><span>- A dash of real physics next to the ray guns and snarky AI, and a greater scale than what is normally seen in sci-fi.</span></p>
<p><span>- A gradual build of humanity from planet-bound to star-faring, eventually resulting in giant space battles.</span></p>
<p><span>- Humans shattering the status quo <em>without </em>being OP. Humans have HFY-style advantages, but they are grounded in reality and don't guarantee a win.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>Content warnings are limited to Profanity, which will still be light.</span></p>

Stranded and bewildered, Ethan spends over a year lost in an untamed forest, managing to bide his time and survive while he make sense of his new reality, waiting for rescue. During this time, he creates a little plot of land, all for himself and the surrounding Pokemon---A farm of berry trees, a secluded meadow, and a rough shelter. </p>
<p>One fateful day, Ethan is finally rescued by an experienced Pokémon Ranger named Elise, who helps him arrive at the bustling Eterna City. There, Ethan is introduced to the community of Pokémon trainers, Nurses, and League Officials who welcome him after his harrowing experience. Despite the gentle reception, Ethan feels out of place and uncertain about his future in this unfamiliar world.</p>
<p>Ethan’s lack of confidence in battling Pokémon leads him to pursue a different path. Inspired by his connection with the Pokemon from his clearing and his desire to help both Pokémon and their trainers, he decides to become a move tutor and breeder. As he learns more about the new but familiar world he finds himself in, Ethan begins to discover his true potential. He learns the esoteric art of teaching Pokémon new moves and the interesting science of breeding to bring out the best traits in each Pokémon.</p>

The sickly man's awkward posture and cruel behavior have been replaced with a neat dignity and acerbic wit. Though once listless, he now strives towards his goals with a life-or-death tenacity. Most come away thinking he seems to know too many details about too much. Few can claim to know his motives or his goals. </p>
<p>Yet behind that confident appearance, the primary contributor for an open-world RPG's wiki battles existential dread and things far beyond his ken as he struggles to adapt to a grim, gothic fantasy world mirroring his favorite game. The prospect of fighting against a world-ending calamity loses all of its appeal when it transitions from entertainment to reality. Argrave is spurred towards unwanted heroism to preserve his life as he struggles desperately to keep this sinking ship afloat.</p>

<p>A new world with nearly unlimited possibilities. A status, classes, magic and monsters. Sounds good? Well, for Ilea it didn't come quite as expected as for some other protagonists, nor was there a king or god to welcome her.</p>
<p>The grand quest? Well, she might figure that out someday but for now, a new world with new food is prize enough. Her fists at the ready, she's prepared to punch and get punched, however long it takes and however many limbs she might have to regrow.</p>
<p>A story I've started writing now quite a while ago. Transported to another world, somewhat standard fantasy setting with my beginner attempts to make it dark but funny. There are Litrpg elements here but I do hope it's not too heavy and annoying. The fights should be interesting and aren't just numbers vs numbers. Contrary to the title the protagonist will be quite an offensive fighter.</p>
<p>Ilea Spears is your average sarcastic kick-boxing fast food worker and soon to be student. She will be transported to another world rather conventionally and will be confronted with survival in the wild.</p>
<p>Give it a shot and let me know what you think. My experience is incredibly lacking. If you find yourself hating it early on, do convey your anger in a detailed comment or review :) I want to get better but without any feedback it's simply quite difficult.</p>
<p>Quick heads up: Around chapter 120 there are a bunch of longer PoV changes that I discontinued again shortly after. The Arc around chapters 150-200 is darker than the rest and the themes shift quite a bit. Just know that it goes back to what you've come to know after that section.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
<p>Quick update June 2019: Many complaints regarding the formatting, specifically spacing in conversations and of course the usage of the present tense in the first 36 chapters have been addressed. I'm of course learning by the day but compared to how it was before it should be an improvement at least.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Cole Mercer and his team are no strangers to sacrifice. After all, what are four men compared to millions of lives saved from a nuclear disaster? But as they make their last stand against insurgents, they’re unexpectedly pulled into another world—one on the brink of a demonic incursion.</p>
<p>Thrust into Tenria's realm of magic and steam engines, Cole discovers a power beyond anything he'd imagined: magic—a way to finally win without sacrifice, a power fantasy made real by ancient mana and perfected by modern science.</p>
<p>But his new world might not be so different from the old one, and the stakes remain the same: there are people who depend on him more than ever; people he might not be able to save. Cole and his team are but men, facing unimaginable odds. Even so, they may yet prove history's truth: that, at their core, the greatest heroes are always just human. </p>

<p>Callum had seen things all his life.  There are monsters and beasts living among people, but he learned very early not to admit such things, not if he didn’t want people to think him crazy.</p>
<p>It turns out that the supernatural is real, but at thirty Callum has no desire to be part of that secret.  Not that he has a choice when it turns out he is a mage, albeit one that hasn’t cast any spells in all his life.  There are requirements, duties, and education that the powers that be insist he be subject to.</p>
<p>To hell with that.</p>
<p><strong>Book Two: Renegade Mage</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B5SLK35R"" rel=""noopener ugc nofollow"">Buy on Amazon!</a></p>
<p>After escaping from the Guild of Arcane Regulation and the Bureau of Secret Enforcement, Callum has lost his greatest protection: his obscurity.  Now the powers that be know who he is, and hiding is harder than ever.  Nor is hiding a plan, just a reaction.</p>
<p>Now Callum is forced to decide how he wants to approach the supernatural world, and how he’s going to keep himself secure when the apparatus of government is arrayed against him.  Even if he wanted to live as a mage, that bridge has been thoroughly burned, and even if he wanted to live as a normal person, he is far too deep to close his eyes to what he’s seen.</p>
<p>He has to make his own terms.</p>
<p><strong>Book Three: Heretic Mage</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHZTVKVR"" rel=""noopener ugc nofollow"">Buy on Amazon</a></p>
<p>Callum is at war with the Guild of Arcane Regulation, the organization that governs mages on Earth.  He’s spent most of his time lying low and hiding out, trying to understand what he can do and how he can remain free from their meddling.  What he’s learned is that he can’t.</p>
<p>It’s time to move from reaction to action, and take on GAR and its evils directly.</p>
<p><strong>Book Four: Reclusive Mage</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Guild of Arcane Regulation has fractured, and new forces move on the board.  Callum cannot quite declare victory, for even a weakened GAR still forces him to hide from the world at large, yet he is no longer prepared to run. Instead he builds his own strengths to stand against those who wish to do him harm.</p>
<p>Change, once started, is hard to stop.  Callum’s actions have brought change to the world of the supernatural, but that can bring chaos and destruction even as he eliminates tyranny and corruption.  He has to move beyond being one man against the world, and stand in the world he’s made.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Book Five: Sovereign Mage</strong></p>
<p>The portal to the Night Lands is closed, and vampires are barred from Earth, but at a high cost.  Not only does Callum have to deal with the fallout of the vampire race’s final spasms, but the political consequences of demonstrating his ability and willingness to attack portal worlds directly.  The forces that were moving to control a weakened GAR have come out into the open, and Callum has to deal with stakes much higher than his personal freedom.</p>
<p>It's time to join with his allies and move to open conflict.  Even the secret of supernatural presence on Earth is at play, and Archmage’s Council and the Seven Lesser Courts threaten the very concept of human sovereignty.  Everything comes down to removing the would-be tyrants, and so preserving the Earth as it should be.</p>

<p>Okay, so perhaps 'epic' is overselling it a bit, given that there are serious mobility issues on both sides of the conflict, but they're trying their best, bless them.</p>
<p>Then perhaps it is the tale of a reincarnated magical girl lover, excited about finally living out her dreams of slaying evil with the powers of love and friendship?</p>
<p>But again, the way a truck-wielding goddess interpreted her request to return her memories immediately after reincarnation rather too literally means that it'll be a long time before the frilly dress fits, and the demons don't seem to want to wait.</p>
<p>Then it's the tale of a pair of new parents growing progressively more confused at the weird happenings around them, particularly when people start receiving involuntary flower-based makeovers? Of an unborn hero speedrunning the plot so efficiently that it'll all be over before she even gets around to being born?</p>

<p>For there is one constant in his new life:</p>
<p>Growth.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Hello there, Author here. Here's what you need to know to see if Hyperion Evergrowing is for you!</p>
<p>This book is a monster evolution story, and that will never change, but the initial goals of our protagonist revolve around him trying to reconnect with his humanity. Things change over time, but a lot of the first book explores what its like to be forcibly altered against your will, and the consequences of that change on a very personal, and somewhat depressing way. This obviously isn't for everyone, and there's a lot of fair criticism directed at the story, but I think the narrative goes in interesting and unique places because of it. </p>
<p>Hyperion is less power fantasy / wish self-fulfilment than some other series, but that doesn't mean Leif is weak in anyway. It turns out there are several advantages to the protagonist's situation, and while they don't instantly turn him into a god of war capable of defeating anything with his eyes closed, Leif does grow into a force to be reckoned with. </p>
<p>The story has a heaping of animal companions, some light kingdom building, heavy world building, and lots of character development for both the MC and a host of side characters. </p>
<p>Oh, there's also a subplot about the origin of the system itself. </p>
<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>",4.68,LitRPG;Reincarnation;Progression;War and Military;Martial Arts;Action;Adventure;Fantasy;Sci-fi;Male Lead;Strong Lead;Non-Human Lead;Magic;High Fantasy;Ruling Class;Soft Sci-fi;Artificial Intelligence

Then life happened, and the universe was changed forever. Only a teeny-tiny bit, but definitely different. Then again, the universe changes a teeny-tiny bit every second of every day. For instance, if someone were to get off the couch and randomly drink a glass of milk? Bam! One less glass of milk in the universe. Changed <em>forever</em>. Well, excluding any time-travel shenanigans, but anyone who puts a big old hole in the time-space continuum just to un-drink a glass of milk should really reevaluate their priorities. Unless, of course, they were attempting to prevent some massive catastrophe vis-a-vis said glass of milk. Such a scenario is by no means impossible, as one should never underestimate the importance of calcium.</p>
<p>Another important tip for any life forms out there is to keep things in perspective. Some look at the vastness of creation in relation to themselves and go, ‘Man, this sucks!’ These people really need to narrow their focus. Sure, they will never affect anything happening on the other end of the galaxy, but so what? That’s way the heck over there, where it doesn’t matter. Therefore, in order to maintain a healthy mindset, it is important to narrow one’s perspective to the things and people that affect them, and that they can affect in turn.</p>
<p>But what happens if one is an unfathomable cosmic being from beyond the veil of reality? What happens when such an existence is capable of influencing entire swathes of the universe just by its presence? A creature such as <span>Magh'rathlak the Observer? That particular entity is only about average as far as reality-warping creatures from the dawn of time go, so its influence over the fabric of reality is rather limited. And it still struggles to keep things in perspective. That, among other things, is why it decided to narrow its worldview a bit by compressing the maddening vastness of its being into a single corporeal form. Magh'rathlak had never tried such a feat, but that wasn't about to stop it.</span></p>

It's only when she starts looking for answers that she discovers just how deep the rabbit hole goes, and just how many others there may be in the world, dripping with the smell of fresh blood and leading up, up, up, deeper into a place she cannot comprehend.</p>
<p>What else is tied to this strange world of flesh? What other people have been touched by it, and that which inhabits it? What are the sides to this conflict she can't yet see?</p>
<p>What will she become as she digs deeper into what is- and what might be?</p>

Humanity has been largely united under a single government for two centuries, scarcity has been all but eliminated, and the human lifespan has been extended further than ever before, with many living for five centuries or longer. Yet cracks have begun to form in this utopia. Progress in science has outpaced social values, leading to conflict as the new generation struggles with the prospect of perpetual disenfranchisement under their all-but-unaging elders.</p>
<p>In this era of transition, a class of gifted young arcanists are invited to attend a conclave held by the enigmatic Order of the Universal Panacea, an ancient organization devoted to pursuing the secret of true immortality. Several of the participants, however, have ulterior motives for attending, including Utsushikome of Fusai, a young prodigy of Thanatomancy whose grandfather was once a member.</p>
<p>But unbeknownst to them, there is a curse on the Order of the Universal Panacea. One does not defy death and the natural order lightly. And an uninvited guest may already lurk among them; one that is not human.</p>
<p>In the end, all of them will have to ask: What can be found in this world, that is truly eternal?</p>
<p>The curtain rises on this, mankind's final battle with entropy, and the possible outcomes are death, or a slightly later, more complicated form of death. Even so, please try to enjoy yourself.</p>

<p>Rare classes and powerful skills are helpful. Too bad the system doesn't seem built to handle them. What even are all these errors? </p>
<p>Our team of outcasts and adventurers will have to rely on their trust - and the bane of all stories, <em>healthy communication</em> - just to survive, let alone understand what the system is doing. Because they're quickly realizing that not all is as it seems, and it's doing something to people, to monsters, and maybe even to the gods themselves.</p>
<p>And their goal isn't just to survive; it's to make things better. It's a good thing they're not doing it alone.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Edge Cases is an attempt to take the LitRPG genre and the overpowered MCs trope and write a story where numbers aren't everything. Sometimes it takes trust, support, and just a touch of being very, very clever.</p>
<p>Expect a mix of action, slice-of-life, friendship, and ominous worldbuilding.</p>

<p>When she woke up in her favorite otome video game, she wasn't expecting to open the eyes of Gerda the npc troll. </p>
<p>It's been five years. Five long, intense years of leveling up and dungeon delving and treasure hunting and working her butt off to give everyone the happily ever after her favorite characters deserved. And she's managed well so far. </p>
<p>Season two is coming to a close, and the final season almost upon her. There are dragons in her future, and something even more terrifying: a lot of walking. Can she help her stan find love? Can she complete her work and find a way home? And can she hide the fact that she is Madame Potts? </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Julian van Slyke watched his father die to protect their home in the revolution twenty years ago in a battle that split the country into a grand ravine... and he's been working hard to walk in those footsteps ever since. </p>
<p>To grow strong, he's been guarding the border to the Untamed Ice Fields, where a dungeon break sends out monsters to challenge their defenses in surges. He is determined to find the dungeon and defeat it, and prove to himself that he is ready to take over the duchy. </p>
<p>Now his home is being threatened by Blackfog spies, portents of doom are keeping him too long from the border, and he's caught up in something much bigger than he can understand. Not only that, he keeps tripping on Gerda no matter where he turns. Can he keep everyone safe? Can he conquer the dungeon his father didn't? And can he resist teasing a certain bridge troll? </p>

<p><strong>The apocalypse <em>will</em> be televised!</strong></p>
<p>A man. His ex-girlfriend's cat. A sadistic game show unlike anything in the universe: a dungeon crawl where survival depends on killing your prey in the most entertaining way possible.<br/><br/>In a flash, every human-erected construction on Earth—from Buckingham Palace to the tiniest of sheds—collapses in a heap, sinking into the ground.<br/><br/>The buildings and all the people inside have all been atomized and transformed into the dungeon: an 18-level labyrinth filled with traps, monsters, and loot. A dungeon so enormous, it circles the entire globe.<br/><br/>Only a few dare venture inside. But once you're in, you can't get out. And what's worse, each level has a time limit. You have but days to find a staircase to the next level down, or it's game over. In this game, it's not about your strength or your dexterity. It's about your followers, your views. Your clout. It's about building an audience and killing those goblins with style.<br/><br/><strong>You can't just survive here. You gotta survive big.</strong><br/><br/>You gotta fight with vigor, with excitement. You gotta make them stand up and cheer. And if you do have that ""it"" factor, you may just find yourself with a following. That's the only way to truly survive in this game—with the help of the loot boxes dropped upon you by the generous benefactors watching from across the galaxy.<br/><br/>They call it <em>Dungeon Crawler World</em>. But for Carl, it's anything but a game.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left"">In the war-torn land of Cyraveil, four heroes strove to overthrow an empire. By cold steel and elemental sorcery, they brought peace to a warring land on the brink of destruction. As the flames died, the realm needed strong leadership, and who better than the champions who had saved the kingdom? But when the people sought out their saviors... they vanished.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left"">Matt, Blake, Jen, and Carl: the four mysterious companions, who together had deposed an insane ruler and saved countless lives, were gone—spirited back in a whirlwind of magic to a sleepy suburb in Mellbridge, Oregon, never to return. The friends found themselves home in the real world, exactly as they'd been the night they were taken, as if no time had passed... except only three came back.</p>

<p>Hi there! This was my entry for National Novel Writing Month, because why only write one series at a time? The more the merrier! (meanwhile, my keyboard bursts into flames...)</p>
<p>I'm also the writer of <a href=""/fiction/18574"" rel=""noopener ugc nofollow"">The Last Science</a>, an ongoing low-fantasy/speculative sci-fi series. If you're familiar with that, you know what to expect here: lots of character-focused drama and dialogue, not a whole lot of traditional action. However, I'm writing a bit differently than usual here, and in a <em>very</em> different structure, so there should be some surprises for returning readers. I hope you enjoy it!</p>

Jarl Vale wants to become Lord Protector, spurred by his ambitious brother Konstans. Jarl Isarn likewise seeks this power; he is aided – or thwarted – by the return of his brother, the knight and war hero Athelstan, whose squire, Brand, hopes to restore his family’s fortunes, cost what it may. Through all of this, an enigmatic traveller makes plans with jarls, scribes, and priests for his own purpose. Abroad, powerful forces sense division in the realms of Adalmearc and make their own plans. It is only a matter of time before schemes clash, plots collide, and conflict erupts. War is on the horizon.</p>

<div>Qube was designed to die.<br/><br/>As the cheerful childhood NPC companion who helps the [Player] learn the world during the start of the game, it was only natural that the big bad would kill her at the end of the tutorial, kick-starting the Player on a quest for vengeance.</div>

<div>The only thing is, no one told her that...</div>

<div>And this particular Player doesn’t like to play by the rules. Being a chaos-loving gremlin, he glitches her out of her programming and drags her on various adventures. They'll grapple with friendly sharktopuses, Evil Emperors, and what it means to be a person.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>On the way they pick up equally unlikely party members, with Qube breaking the world in increasingly strange ways as she seeks to be the very best Companion ever. All the while, Qube herself slowly realizes that her reality is not quite what it seems.</div>

<p>Mostly it's about walking in the woods with a friend, looking for mushrooms to put in your soup, or haggling with the guy selling squash, or taking care of a neglected garden. It's putting some jam on shortbread biscuits. And yes, sometimes you go down into the dungeons with your friends, and you kill monsters there, or disarm traps, but when you come out, you realize you've found the perfect magic item to give to one of the local kids that helped you out when your cat was sick. Look, the dungeons are always going to be there, and sometimes you need to make a journey to one of the Spirit Gates, or make a pilgrimage with the local Cleric of Symmetry to a holy shrine. Your tour through the local dungeons can wait. You'll have rivalries with other groups, and find some dungeon eggs that need to be carefully incubated in case they turn out to be something valuable, and help a friend to build a fishing weir.

<p>- Male protagonist focus with occasional Interludes from other perspectives</p>
<p>- Genuine romance between the MC and the women in his life</p>
<p>- Slow corruption of moral standards, and a kind of gradual, creeping horror, like faces in the corner of the room at night that only grow more distinct as your eyes adjust to the light</p>

When humanity created their own giant mechanized combat units to fight against the monsters at their door, he was merely one of thousands to step up and fight for the cause. But the best surviving pilot humanity has ever known doesn’t fight for glory or honor. Not even to save the lives he’s sworn his life to protect.

Their underdog story and humble beginnings elevated them to worldwide acclaim. Media corporations dubbed them, <strong>The Paragons</strong>. With their main competition eliminated from the tournament during the semifinals, the rookie team sailed through the live finals and won by a landslide. Their prize was to become the first ever players in the most exclusive VR game yet, <strong>Abidden</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">The Paragons never celebrated that semi-final victory. They lost a friend in that match, who never appeared online again. Ten years later, the gaming landscape has changed and Abidden with it. Helena is the last remaining Paragon. Her <em>team </em>now consists of celebrities, influencers and musicians. Abidden has been reduced to a shadow of its former glory, but is the most streamed and viewed game in the world, despite having only a handful of players.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">None of this matters to James Sylvester. Finally out of hospital, things aren't good for James. He's found himself crippled with medical debt, his gaming licence has been revoked and he's permanently lost his place in society. He now spends his days competing in illegal slum arcades to manage the repayments. When a high-profile job comes along, James gets temporary backdoor access to his blacklisted gaming account. After reactivating it for the first time in ten years, James receives an invitation that could change his life forever.</span></p>

<p>Until she meets Raine and Evelyn, that is — self-proclaimed bodyguard and bad-tempered magician — and learns she’s not insane at all. The spirits and monsters she sees are all too real, the god-thing in her nightmares is teaching her how to surpass human limits, and her twin sister who supposedly never existed could still be alive, somewhere Outside, beyond the walls of reality.</p>
<p>Heather plunges into a world of eldritch magic and fanatic cultists, trying to stay alive, stay sane, and deal with her own blossoming attraction to dangerous women. But being ‘In The Know’ isn’t all terror and danger. Sometimes the monsters wear nice dresses and stick around for afternoon tea. Sometimes you find you have more in common with them than you think. Perhaps this is Heather’s chance to be something more than the defeated husk she’d grown up as, to find real friendship and meaning among things like herself - and perhaps, out there on the rim of the possible, to bring her twin sister back from the dead.</p>

<p><strong>Birth of a Legend</strong>, the first short, follows Captain Erskine Erwell, a newly promoted Captain in the Calandorian Royal Navy, charged with protecting his people from all who would do them harm. Great news for the Calandorian citizens, bad news for the Skjar reavers that ravage the shores in search of slaves. But when a small reaver fleet slips the net and escapes to the southern jungles of Marduk, Erwell must fight a war on two fronts; one against the raiders, and a far more difficult war against the hostile landscape. If he can't find allies in this strange land, he may end up being the one in need of saving. </p>
<p><strong>The Calling</strong> follows Ferez Ahud, an aspiring young battlemage charged with the unsavoury job of 'terminating' a rogue member of his college. But how this nobody of a mage became a fugitive remains a mystery, and when the answer is discovered, the tables are turned and the hunter becomes the prey.</p>
<p><strong>A Family Dissassemblance</strong> follows a young woman named Elizabeth. She's a simple young gal; sweet, charming, and with a heart of gold. She loves her family, she loves fun, and she loves making things and people explode! </p>
<p><strong>Blood Reparations </strong>picks up Levi's story a little while after he and Erskine parted ways at the end of Birth of a Legend. Read along as Levi struggles to find a solution for his village's woes, battling the attitudes of obnoxious foreign snobs, drakes (again!), and something altogether far more sinister, lurking deep underground...</p>
<p><strong>A Vow of Wind </strong>takes us back to the dynamic trio of Ferez, Ingrid, and affable idiot, Leo! This time, the happy couple's comfortable lives of hiring their services out as battlemages is interrupted when Leo asks to tag along on a job. Things escalate quickly in a life or death race from Aderath all the way to the frozen north.</p>
<p><strong>For King and Country</strong> is currently in the process of being uploaded. It follows Captain Erskine Erwell as he escorts a servant of the Crown attempting to piece together the truth of a Royal Army unit's disappearance within Calandor's borders. What starts out as a routine hunt to purge corruption and treason escalates as the captain uncovers signs something sinister is happening in the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS STORY - 'TIS THE SEASON<em>. </em></strong>This has nothing to do with the other stories in the anthology, its just a fun little Christmas story that popped into my head one day that I decided to jot down and throw up for your (hopeful) enjoyment. It follows a young mercenary standing guard over demonic badlands on Christmas Eve. Things start off bad and get rapidly worse as he faces off against threats mere humans were never meant to face. But as the bloody night continues and the body count rises, salvation may come from an unexpected corner...</p>

They disappear every day and return again at night, mindless and hungry, hunting for any survivors. He’ll need to use cunning and subterfuge to avoid them, because since he was transported into the body of a child, he can’t level up. At least not yet.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-align: left"">Bog Standard. It means “totally normal”, right? But for the small towns found in these bogs, there's no quick rescue and not much trade. Everything has to be made to last. To them, it means ""excellent quality"". Mark will have to prove he's Bog Standard if he hopes to survive.</span></p>
<p>This is an Isekai of excellent quality. It’s a progression fantasy set in a LitRPG world, rags to riches with an eventual OP main character. The pacing is slow-burn, incremental progression, sometimes slice-of-life, punctuated by moments of intense violence and possibly traumatic content.</p>

He plateaued long ago, lacking whatever secret sauce that produced the legendary adventurers he grew up admiring. With his prime behind him and disillusioned by guild politics, Hans accepts a guild master posting in a remote village. Usually, guild masters had to be Diamond-ranked, but the guild was happy to accept Hans’ voluntary exile to fill an insignificant position no one else wanted.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Looking forward to a quiet life of teaching, Hans arrives in the small town of Gomi at the foot of the Dead End Mountains. As he sets his mind to rebuilding the local chapter of the Adventurers’ Guild, his unconventional teaching methods earn him allies and enemies, while his career failures find ways to resurface.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">This slice of life fantasy explores a life post-adventuring and the challenge of reconciling dreams with reality. The author describes the tone as “if lofi fantasy beats were a LitRPG.”</span></p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The version of ""cozy"" in Dead End Guild Master aims to be more akin to the cozy feelings found in stories like Frieren, Battle Mage Farmer, or Delicious in Dungeon and less like Beware of Chicken (a great book, though). That means conflicts exist and the world isn't bright and cheery all the time, giving the cozy moments a different flavor in one author's opinion. <span style=""font-weight: 400""></span></p>

<p>General Summary:</p>
<p>Sometimes, the multiverse needs expanding. That's where I come in. But, unfortunately, being a deity isn't all fun and games (and is incredibly complicated), as there are always things working against you. Not even the God of the Multiverses can change that. </p>
<p>Another Summary:</p>
<p>Twelve souls were chosen to expand into the void surrounding the known universe(s), and were given a grace period in which they would experience a relatively safe expansion of their domains. Once that period is up, however, they are free to interact with each other...and what lurks in the depths of the Abyss, the Void, and the Primordial Chaos. I am one of those souls. And let me tell you, this shit ain't easy. Between trying to raise mortals into an immortal army, with which I can defend my domain, dealing with my children, and trying to maintain the balance between all realms of existance, I have my work cut out for me. <em>Sigh. </em>Now I know why, back on Earth, gods worked in mysterious, invisible ways. There's just too much to be done. </p>

<p>I exhausted pretty much every time loop story ever written and decided to write my own. You'll see a few similarities here between this story and some existing stories, at least initially. There's a lot of inspiration drawn from both MoL and Re:Zero, though in terms of pathos and darkness, this story leans more towards the latter. Be warned, it is something of a slow burn. The main character will grow and become powerful, but a theme of this story is that power comes slowly and often at great cost. </p>

If you read it anywhere else and have to pay for it or have to deal with an annoying amount of advertisement, You Are Being Betrayed. You would do good if you make other people in that network aware of it. This is a free project of mine for the purpose of having fun. And if people try to make money with it you shouldn't bother visiting their website.

<p>No, we don't want you to fight the demon lord! Of course not; we're the good guys! What sort of good guys kidnap people from other worlds and force them to take part in wars that have nothing to do with them? That would just be plain evil! We'd be no better than the demons!</p>
<p>Katie, after her summoning by an excessively loud mage suddenly takes an unexpected twist, is sent off on a simple fetch quest, with a promise that she'll be back home in five minutes at most. She doesn't even need to leave the building. Alas, when a goddess' blessing causes her wish for an actual adventure to be taken rather more literally than she expected, she finds herself lost in a dark cave, far away from the sword she was supposed to acquire and far too close to a population of giant bugs. Still, at least she wished her life wasn't in any danger. Among other things.</p>
<p>Be careful what you wish for. You might just get it.</p>
<p>This is a dark litRPG adventure, both in terms of Katie accidentally wishing all the lights out, and also in that she loses as often as she wins, often with horrific and disturbing consequences. Luckily, Katie isn’t the sort of person to let a mere grizzly death or two get her down, and is prepared to try, try and try again to get her hands on the holy sword and finally complete her ‘simple’ fetch quest. Or perhaps—with a few resistance skills under her nightie—she might even come to enjoy losing. Not that she’d ever consider forgoing revenge, even if she did.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I’ve ticked all the content warning checkboxes for this one. Dark things happen to the MC, and she does dark things right back to everything else. There’s no explicit sexual content, but there are more than enough references to justify the warning, including to rape. Profanity happens rarely, but Katie isn’t averse to swearing when she gets particularly angry. As for gore/trauma, it doesn’t get much worse than the first few chapters, but there will be occasional chapters that have extra content warnings. There will be mind control.</p>

<p><strong>What to expect:</strong></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Plot is discovered, not designed.</span> Consequences shape events, rather than scenes being designed to push plot. Upside: characters, relationships, and setting are particularly strong, plot can get WILD in amazing, unexpected ways<em>.</em> Downside: pacing risks getting bogged down until the author finds the groove.</p>
<p>- occasional slowburn sections that may feel a little aimless</p>
<p>- gratuitous violence against unthinking aliens<em><br/></em>- get points, buy gear<br/>- cybernetic upgrades<br/>- organic augmentations<br/>- a perhaps more serious approach to transforming male to female, using sci-fi DNA morphing<br/>- maturity from both female leads<br/>- girls' love, from the soft and cuddly, to the (clearly marked) steamy and kinky explicit<br/>- many, many chapters</p>

His journey landed him in the past of another world, with a set of memories that didn’t really belong to him.

<p>I will endeavor to stay true to the MMO genre while taking a few liberties to make it more interesting. However, this is closer to Slice of Life than anything. There will be drama, action, horror, humor, and everything in between, but I would call this entire thing a guilty pleasure reading (and writing).</p>
<p>I got bored with all those VRMMO novels that start out as VRMMO novels, then escalate into martial cage fights, alien invasions, dream dimensions, or whatever. I also don’t like how in several novels they take real-life skills into the game and the game is like: ‘Aight, you do you, bro!’.</p>
<p>This novel will keep the real world and the game world separate. Also, to me, it seems that many VRMMO writers have never played any MMO or other video games, or heard about things like patches, pacing, and vertical or horizontal gameplay.</p>

<p>An unassuming spacecraft, one of the dozens that fell yearly, descended on Siberia in 2021. The world took no particular notice of it. However, this one contained something beyond the miraculous technology that had made humans so prosperous.</p>
<p>Three years later, in a top-secret underground facility in eastern Colorado, the automated construction of an army of Paladin Mobile Infantry Suits was underway. With this new, state-of-the-art weaponry, the military would turn the tide against the alien incursion that was consuming the planet. Humanity fell before that could happen. Sam was an engineer responsible for overseeing the facility. Now alone, he lives in utter boredom and near insanity, his only company the base’s pseudo AI and an army of empty Paladins. With the world gone to hell around him, and the things that caused it still living above, he decides that he is much better off staying exactly where he is. Unfortunately for him, that is no longer an option.</p>

<p>This is the first novel I've written. The first fifteen or so chapters are going to be a little slower. I want there to be time to get to know the characters before they start blowing stuff up. Also, though the MC will be strong relative to the world, he won't be OP, and won't win every fight. Not every fight will be physical either.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm aiming for something like 5 fairly short chapters a week, after the introduction part is done, but we'll see how that goes. Thanks for reading, and please let me know if I've made mistakes!</p>",4.62,Strategy;Male Lead;Sci-fi;Strong Lead;Action;Adventure

<p>A young orphan works hard every single day, trying to single-handedly keep his parents’ business alive, all the while tortured by a terrible curse.</p>
<p>Then came the day that a wizard became his mentor - and he learned that his entire life was a lie… His parents didn’t just die, they were brutally murdered; he was not cursed at all; his uncle was not in fact his uncle; and he could channel magic! Struggling to rise above the tragedy of his horrific past, he is now thrown into an entirely new world.</p>
<p>Day by day he must push himself to catch up with his new peers, learning the secrets of this vast new world, while studying the arts of combat, weapons, and magic!</p>
<p>Where do his strengths lie? What are his talents? Is he strong enough to overcome the obstacles in his way?</p>
<p>And why is he considered so unique?</p>
<p>The secrets of the academy, of the missing ambassador, of the hidden dragons, and of the empires and kingdoms marching to war in the east - all have been hurled into an abyss so deep that they should never be found.</p>
<p>Yet Yaric grew up in the abyss, and watching his new world get dragged down by the secrets, Yaric is forced to plunge right back in. But as Yaric already knows, staring into the abyss is easy. Falling in is effortless. Rising back out however, that may not be possible at all!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Only for those who want more than a brief synopsis...</em><strong><span><br/>What to expect</span>:</strong></p>
<p>The mc is kind of overpowered, but not in a typical way. And definitely not in an obvious way. He does get more overpowered as the story develops though. Again, not in a normal way.</p>
<p>Yaric is central, but many side characters are very important. The world doesn’t revolve around him.</p>
<p>There will <span><strong>not</strong></span> be any training montages. Power is gained through effort, and training and learning is part of the journey. Some will likely consider the story ‘slow burn’ – the mc is discovered to have magical potential, and then spends many years studying. Lore is revealed as the mc learns. The journey <em>is</em> the story.</p>
<p>The mc’s journey will include training missions, fulfilling appeals (effectively ‘adventuring’), diplomatic missions, small scale skirmishes and large-scale wars encompassing multiple nations. Mysteries and crimes will have to be solved along the way. There will be monsters, creatures hiding in the dark, and apocalyptic behemoths. Oh, and there will be dragons. Very important dragons. They’re coming!</p>
<p>There will be combat, martial arts, different kinds of magic, and various forms of crafting. Different nations have different cultures; politics, trade, and wars between them are important. Battles aren't just groups of soldiers slugging it out. <em>Ok, sometimes they are...</em></p>
<p>It might take a while to get there, but there are overarching plots over and above the minor plots and story arcs. The main plot starts right from the beginning.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The world:</strong></p>
<p>It's less medieval and more Roman Empire/Ancient China, if they both had magic and thousands of years of extra development. Just like they had occupations such as administrators, secretaries, lawyers, architects, acrobats, firemen and accountants, so too does Malvec and the surrounding nations. The sapient population includes humans, elves, dwarves, draugr and lichs. Wildlife includes deer, bears, rabbits blah blah blah... ogres and v<span>ardøgers, trolls and gnolls, hellcats and nightwing bats. And much more!</span></p>
<p>Technology is more advanced, mostly due to the 2 main differences between those empires and nations like Malvec<br/><span>Time</span>: Civilization has been around longer - by thousands of years. Mass production is common. Assembly lines have been developed. Various forms of schools and education are widespread. The jump to steam power, internal combustion engines and electricity (and everything linked to them) is practically the only thing missing. Essentially power generation and storage.<br/><span>Food</span>: Mages drastically enhance food production, making populations both larger and more diverse. Everyone can be fed with far fewer farmers, so a much larger percentage of the population are free to take up other occupations.</p>
<p> </p>

The story is already planned out VERY far into the future, but plot suggestions or pointing out of plot holes would be extremely helpful as well!

Entertainment to be seen at a distance. After turning fifteen, she watched as young people her age got ready for their first journey across Sinnoh, all aiming to become the Champion. She usually scoffed at them, wondering how one could throw away a comfortable life in the city to risk their lives in the wild for an unobtainable goal. And yet when she was asked by her father to deliver a package to her mother living two towns over, something clicked in her brain.</p>

<p><strong>{Book 1: A Den of Wolves} </strong></p>
<p>What if you knew the future? But what if that future was not yours?</p>
<p>After a gruesome death, Carina was reborn in Lafeara as Lady Maura, the unwanted “half-blood” of an impoverished noble family. The previous Lady Maura was publicly executed as part of a conspiracy to conceal the murder of Queen Eleanora.</p>
<p>With Maura’s memories to guide her, Carina prepares to follow her predecessor’s path into the palace as part of the Selection to become Crown Princess Eleanora’s lady-in-waiting. Her meticulous years of planning and preparation to ensure her survival, fulfill Maura’s revenge, and avert the oncoming Calamity will require every ounce of courage, cunning, and intellect she can muster.</p>
<p>Because Carina has more than one secret which she can not reveal—her true identity among them—but even more treacherous is her frozen heart and the ice magic that comes with it.</p>
<p>After all, they still burn witches in Lafeara.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>{Book 2: A Coven of Crows} </strong></p>
<p>The problem with changing the past is that the future changes with it.</p>
<p>Although Carina survived the Selection and earned a place in the palace beside the Crown Princess, her battle to change the future and protect Lady Hana, the future Queen’s favored lady-in-waiting, is far from over.</p>
<p>As Carina becomes further entwined in the hidden witch covens of Lafeara, their history and magic unravel a dangerous secret long forgotten by most. It is not just Maura’s memories that threaten to shift the balance of Carina’s carefully laid plains but her own forgotten past as well.</p>
<p>And the more mysteries Carina uncovers, the fewer allies she finds standing on her side. Everyone wants something, but the most dangerous players in this game of mortals and witches are the gods themselves, who have their own sordid plans for Carina’s frozen heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>{Book 3: A Plague of Witches} </strong></p>
<p>As the annual Royal Hunt approaches, so too do the first signs of the devastating plague Carina foresaw in Maura’s memories. The once lady-in-waiting to the Crown Princess now finds herself in a far better position to steer Lafeara’s future. As allies become enemies and old enemies form alliances for survival, Carina finds herself pulled into the shifting political struggle between Lafeara’s powerful nobles and secret witch covens.</p>
<p>But there is still a chance that Carina and Hana might just make it through the oncoming calamity—that is, if the future doesn’t shift too far from the previous timeline. As the Duchess of Winter dons her armor and prepares for the Crown Prince’s coronation, another attempted assassination, a witch-born plague, and the approaching forces of Pope Jericho and his Witch Hunters, only one thing is certain.</p>
<p>The gods themselves are pulling the strings of fate to force the future Carina has fought so hard to change back towards its inevitable conclusion. Now Carina, like Maura, must face the chains of her own mortality—or completely break free.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Marcus has played any number of VR games, beta-tested dangerous and unstable systems and lived to tell the tale. He even has a certain amount of fame and influence within...certain circles. He usually disdains the idea of pre-orders and their respective ""perks"" as blatent commerical exploitation, but this time the bonus is too tempting to pass up. The ability to craft your character's backstory and have it integrated into the game's lore is enough for him to sign up for the Early Access program. He isn't interested in being all-powerful. Frankly, he's been there and done that enough to be bored of the whole thing. Instead, he opts to make a character purely for the purpose of having fun. Things aren't quite what they seem however, and his ""backstory"" and character class have implications he never would have imagined.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Author Note: First time posting a story online, and I'd appreciate any feedback. Updates may be slow, as each ""chapter"" will likely be in the 10,000 word range and I tend to revise several times before being (tentatively) satisfied. If people seem to like this I'll try to establish a regular post schedule.</p>",4.62,Virtual Reality;Reincarnation;Anti-Hero Lead;Male Lead;Sci-fi;Fantasy;LitRPG;Harem;Magic

There are many different types of worlds, from the paradise worlds where everyone is immortal, to the resource depleted, war-torn planets where every day is a struggle just to live.</p>
<p>Freya O'Malley grew up on Earth, the worst of the war-torn planets, and wants nothing more than to leave. With few options, Freya joins the Federation Marines. But, unlike the past, it's a struggle to earn enough enlistment points to stay in. With the prize of a citizenship on a paradise world at stake, competition is fierce. Every week is a new war. Can Freya earn enough points in the constant warring of the Marines to modify her body and mind to stay competitive? Can a girl from the wrong planet make it against those who have all the advantages?</p>

Unfortunately for Arlo, there is no tutorial, and he is immediately forced to tackle a Delve set to the highest difficulty with a party of adventurers who are not only strangers to him, but strangers to each other as well. Arlo has no armor, no weapons, no knowledge of the world at large, and his party is growing increasingly suspicious of his lack of preparation and paper-thin excuses for how he got there.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Determined not to die </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400"">again</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400"">, Arlo forgoes putting any points into his highest stat, Intelligence, and instead dumps everything he's got into Fortitude. After all, who needs equipment or fighting skills when you can eat fireballs for breakfast and still ask for more hot sauce?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Mage Tank is a comedic LitRPG adventure set in an epic fantasy world that is rapidly evolving as new and powerful secrets of the Delves are uncovered. There are strong horror themes, graphic violence, overindulgent use of naughty language, and poorly constructed jokes. Mage Tank features slow progression and intelligent characters who spend time making intentional build choices. It’s not action all-the-time, but Arlo’s life is replete with danger and, more importantly, consequences.</span></p>

More often than not, it is necessary to trim the fat in order to bring what really matters to the forefront. Having extra bulk may seem like a good idea, but in reality it is merely a crutch that will one day become a hindrance, as it is no substitute for personality nor ability. Indeed, often times it is the small things in life that brighten up our daily lives and constantly remind us exactly why we do the things we do.</p>
<p>However, it is important to keep an open mind, for while bigger is not always better, there are also times when it is. This holds especially true when it comes to hopes and dreams, which have been known to require a suitably large container from time to time. And while dreaming big could potentially lead to massive dissapointment, one will never truly reach fulfilment if they think too small.</p>

95704,An Elder's Revolution - The Art of Sect Politics,an-elders-revolution-the-art-of-sect-politics,True,Ongoing,2025-04-13T16:08:10.0000000+00:00,1991,640,539326,"<p><strong>Honored by countless victories grasped and foes vanquished, Sect Elder Liu Wei is one of the most prominent figures of the Lunar Peaks Sect.</strong></p>
<p>Known for his strict treatment of those below him and the harsh punishments he hands out to those who cross him, his name invokes both fear and awe to the sect's countless members, disciples and subordinates.</p>
<p>As a breakthrough leads him to ascend to the same level of cultivation as the sect's patriarch, he is well-positioned to further extend his power within the sect. Only, what should have been his greatest moment of triumph is instead one doubt and uncertainty: For the first time in his well over four-hundred year long journey of cultivaton, he has hit a complete roadblock, denying him any further steps on the way to immortality.</p>
<p>Without a family, any close friends or a particularly deep loyalty towards his sect, this leaves Liu Wei without a purpose to dedicate his efforts towards, even as the flame of ambition keeps burning in his chest. He now has no choice but to deeply contemplate what he wishes to do with the vast power he has spent his unfathomably long life accumulating.</p>
<p>As his contemplations lead him to rediscover a long discarded sense of compassion, a new goal beginns to form: bring as much justice and fairness into this ancient system of opression as his abilities afford him to.</p>
<p><strong>Liu Wei shall walk on a path of defiance.</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Quick overview of what you can expect from this story:</p>
<p>This is a story about Liu Wei, but it will be told from many perspectives. Giving the perspectives of several important side-characters room to breathe is my way of dealing with a main-character who is several centuries old and thus rather knowledgeable about the world and difficult to surprise. All of these characters have their own little stories and sub-plots that will be explored as the main story moves on.</p>
<p>As the title says, this novel will focus on sect politics. This includes detailed explorations of schemes, power-dynamics and the like. Action will be rather sparse, especially in the beginning. Most conflicts will need time to build up before ultimately erupting into violence. They will though, and when they do I hope the action will feel gratifying and consequential.</p>
<p>This story features power-progression in the form of cultivation. This includes the MC who <em>will</em> eventually regain his ability to cultivate, if you're concerned about that. This progression is featured prominently as a motivation for many characters, but will not be the focus of the story itself. The MC is already at a very high level of cultivation and will thus take a long time to progress further.</p>
<p>The world-building is one of the things I love most about writing, as such you can expect it to be detailed and extensive. The supernatural elements and cultivation system(s) are built from the ground up with their own internal logic in a way that I hope makes sense. I try to stay rather grounded with them - we won't be encountering anyone throwing cities or splitting mountains for a long time (if ever).</p>
<p>Questions of morality and ethics are central to the plot of this novel and will thus be explored in adequate detail in the form of both internal reflection and debates. Of course this isn't a philosophic essay, so these sections will mostly remain relatively short.</p>
<p>The tone of this story is usually rather serious, but there are occasionaly slight satirical elements as it seeks to subvert expectations regarding common Xianxia tropes.</p>

Never in his wildest dreams had he been expecting to end up in the place of the ruler he had chosen when he started the game.</p>
<p>Theoretically, this wouldn't be too bad, trading modern amenities for the life of royalty/nobility.</p>
<p>Of course, that's if he had picked someone with immense power like the Kaiser of the Holy Roman Empire, or some random count in a stable part of Europe for a simpler life.</p>
<p>Of course though, he had to have gone and chosen young Queen Isabella II of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, right at the tail end of the Fifth Crusade when she was only eight years old. All because he thought it'd have been an 'interesting and fun challenge' to try and subvert her fate in history.</p>
<p>Now he has to do it for real and reality is far different from the games. If he doesn't want to end up as the historical footnote she ended up becoming, he'll need to weave his way through a world seemingly set to prevent the rise of someone exactly like Isabella.</p>

This is for a variety of reasons, ranging from caution to amusement, but is generally because after a few hundred millennia and enough prayers to fill a hollow Earth, you're bound to learn the art of delegation. Luckily, among the unwashed masses, there exist the exceptional, the gifted, those with the potential to become Heroes.</p>
<p><em>Useful pawns.</em></p>
<p>Thus, the Gods adopted a more laissez-faire policy.</p>
<p>Quasi Eludo has been a Hero. He did the whole ""save the world” rigmarole, came home, and mulled over his magical journey. It was amazing! A whole lifetime as the destined savior, with magic and monsters, love and adventure, lifelong friendships and heartfelt goodbyes. There was so much, and yet, gone so soon.</p>
<p>It wasn’t enough. It was never enough. He wanted to do it again.  And where wants coincide, there's a market, so he sold his services to the lazy, wanton Gods. </p>

<p><strong><span>Quasi Eludo, Hero for Hire. </span></strong>[No world too big, no quest too small]</p>

<p></p>
<p>Now, after traveling to twenty nine different worlds, Quasi Eludo finds himself against a far different battle. One that involves the worst, most evil organizations in subjective human history. An organization known as the Internal Revenue Service. An organization that has hounded our Hero ever since his first divine payment.</p>
<p>Regardless, Quasi Eludo is ready for this. A court date is set, documents are ready, his lawyers have been to the gym, and their suits are appropriately sized.</p>
<p>And with no summoning expected or schedules on that day, nothing should absolutely go wrong.</p>
<p>And even if something does go wrong, how bad can it truly get? </p>

<p><strong>What happens when an emotionless killer is transported to another place, when a man who was trained to hunt in the skies above barren ash-lands now becomes the last protector of the perfect garden below instead?</strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">The one-thousand year crisis has begun.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">The world tree, towering up toward the heavenly skies, is the greatest beacon of resilience and peace that there is. Saturated with deeply set, ancient magical energies, it is the most powerful source of ambient, restorative magic that the dying world has ever known. Guarded solely now by its last pacifistic caretaker, a forest dryad, it seems inevitable that it will soon be destroyed with nobody around who is strong enough to protect it from the steadily approaching danger.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Rising from the shadows, horrific monsters from forgotten eras tear through the world in the steadily growing waves of their invasion, breaking free from their ancient prisons deep below its surface as they rampage and destroy the cities of men, elves, and all the other races of the many continents. Filled with nothing but an intent to kill, the system-manifested hordes march toward the last garden in order to bring about the end of the last era.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">As one nation after the other falls, everything seems lost, until fate intervenes and a rift between worlds opens, bringing in the only hope the many nations, the sacred tree, as well as its peace-loving caretaker, have against the endless tide of blood and fangs — a transmigrated war pilot, flying an experimental combat aircraft, the <em>Jagdflugzeug-09</em> 'Kestrel'.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Is this one man enough to stop the monster invasions, which grow stronger and stronger with every subsequent wave? Can the pilot with no name carry the fate of the world upon his wings, or can he only watch from above as the fires of the apocalypse reach up to the sky to consume him as well before the fall of final darkness?</span></p>

<p><b>Upgrade. Consume. Evolve. Whether it’s cybernetics or mutations, this world demands you be more than human.</b></p>
<p>Every century, the MALswarm invades — adaptive aliens of blood and steel led by Titans that decimate billions and leave behind raw Warp Energy. Humanity seizes this power, transforming into beings of mutated flesh and cybernetic might. Yet the promised utopia remains a lie, and New California’s underworld schemes to profit from the impending Fifth Swarm.</p>
<p>Amidst the chaos, two destinies collide. Ripley — a cybernetics savant battling to save his dying mother — operates in the shadows of a gang-owned nightclub. Diana, engineered for perfection, fights as an officer of the law to forget her past. When a monster is unleashed, they steal its infinite potential to <em>warp</em> their futures with their newfound powers.</p>
<p>In a city where salvation and damnation are inseparable, Ripley reinvents himself from the wreckage of his enemies' cybernetics as a mercenary who will one day become an architect of ruin. Diana's mutated blood crackles with lightning as she purges corruption, igniting into a storm of change. The intertwined legends of Dreadwire and Silvereye will evoke fear and hope into the world. Against a grand conspiracy of aliens, rogue AIs, shady corporations, organized crime and centuries of forgotten history, their alliance — and conflict — determines if the world will plunge into darkness or embrace the light.</p>
<p><strong>Wrong City? Wrong People? No. This is the right city, and they're the only ones who can save this dystopian future.</strong></p>

<p>updates once a week until I get more time</p>
<p>The idea for this story began in two places. One was the ridiculously rapid pace of gaining power in many novels. Both in games and in novels, I enjoy the struggle of the beginning character, why always the rush? The other was the way many monster or non-human MCs always seem to hurry to become human (again). It always felt like a cheap way to grant the character extra powers without the difficulty of writing a non-standard thought process.</p>
<p>Thus I wanted to write the slow(ish) progression of a monster character gaining strength and intelligence, while remaining distinctly non-human. There are no stats, xp or systems, no reincarnated soul or completely formed being to start with - unless I want to make fun of those. While the MC 'evolves', the process takes months if not years to proceed step by little step.

<p>Colm Avery is a warlock. You know, the ""sell your soul for unlimited power"" kind of warlock. Except for the part where he sells his soul. That never sat well with him.</p>
<p>Instead he sells the souls of others. Murderers. He trades the souls of those already destined for hell for gifts. It's hard work. For six years he's worked 18+ hour days, taking breaks when he could or when he simply passed out from exhaustion. Finally, a windfall lands in his lap that allows him some free time.

<p>Dylan is your average nerd. He works downtown for an architecture firm during the day and enjoys all manner of games and media in his spare time. But while Dylan likes all forms of sci-fi and fantasy, he really likes the genre of superheroes.</p>
<p>So when an indie company releases a virtual reality MMO where players choose to play as heroes or villains, Dylan immediately buys into it. He has a specific type of character he really enjoys watching, something that always makes his inner child laugh in delight. The Saturday morning cartoon villain.</p>
<p>Yes, those inept, bungling, yet highly dangerous villains found in so many of Dylan's cartoons as a child. He loves how they always come up with strange ways to conquer the world and how they get thwarted every weekend. He remembered laughing at every silly antic, every cliched shout of ""Curses! Foiled again!"" He loves it so much he decides to take this idea into the MMO.</p>
<p>But to grab a playerbase, the company has announced a promotion that players with a high enough reputation can get contacted to become permanent raid bosses in the game. Those chosen will be paid as if employees of the company. Serious players all hoping to live the dream of playing videogames all day rush to purchase copies of World of Supers!</p>

Then, suddenly, she was punted into another dimension. A dimension where magic and monsters roam the land, and, for some reason, a System keeps dinging at her and telling her that her stats and levels are increasing. As someone who loves exploring mysteries, Alice is determined to get to the bottom of this mystery. After all, everything has to have a ‘cause,’ including the System, right?</p>
<p>(This story is also posted on Royalroad. If you see this story anywhere besides Royalroad, Scribblehub, KU, or Patreon it has been stolen).</p>
<p>What to expect: This story is going to be a LitRPG set in a fantasy world. However, unlike many LitRPG’s, the system has both a definite beginning and definite limits to what it is able to accomplish – rather than a singularly omnipotent, omniscient being that is tied to the laws of the world, the way systems are usually presented in LitRPG’s, the system is close to both, but has definite limits and rules which it operates by.</p>

Oh, and, if the opportunity arises, take revenge on his best friend turned murderer.</p>
<p>Ashlani was sent on his inaugural hunt as the chieftain-to-be of his tribe when he was shot in the back by the man he was closest to, the one he called his closest friend. Post-mortem, he was greeted by a [System], the elect, singular keelish representative. Now, his focus must be on continuous growth and evolution, to awaken to his grand potential, and lead his new people to a new age.</p>
<p>This is a reboot of my previous novel, Ashlani's Reincarnation, a grimdark take on a LitRPG reincarnation novel. This is a slower, more methodical approach to story, and I hope that its quality will reflect that. I update five times a week, usually every weekday.</p>

<p><strong>What to Expect:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>-A Cultivation Tale Written for Fans of Epic Fantasy and Berserk (Golden Age)-</strong></em></p>
<p>-<strong><em>Lovingly Crafted &amp; Efficient Prose</em></strong>-</p>
<p>-<em><strong>An Intelligent Yet Flawed Main Character</strong>-</em></p>
<p><em>-<strong>An Animal Companion</strong>-</em></p>
<p>-<strong><em>An Unfolding Story That Will Eventually Span the Globe</em></strong>-</p>
<p>-<em><strong>Weak to Strong Progression Fantasy</strong>-</em> Grounded in emotion and personal motivation. Progression is a consistent theme, and this story will take the time to ensure it feels meaningful in a broader sense. While Ren will receive a few advantages at several points, the goal is progression that feels earned.</p>
<p>-<em><strong>Gritty, Well Thought Out Combat</strong>- </em>Trying to fight against a spear with your sword? Better find a way to compensate for the gap in reach. Take an arrow to the face? You're taking a dirt nap. Fireball? I think you can see where I'm going. Complete with<em><strong> tactical fighting, archery, martial arts, monster battles, and xianxia-inspired magic system.</strong></em></p>
<p>-<strong><em>A Non-Typical Xianxia Setting</em></strong>- An original world that takes inspiration from the blending of cultures facilitated by the Silk Road at its height. The world is in a constant state of flux and over the course of the story we will see it transform as power changes hands and new technologies shift the balance of civilization. Heavily flavored with middle-eastern influence and dollops of classic fantasy, this is not another clone of ancient china, though eventually we will see some of the classic tropes such as young masters, honor duels, and cultivator sects. Some of these will be deconstructed, some will be played with because they are fun and/or awesome. Don't worry,<strong> <em>this is not a harem story.</em></strong></p>
<p>-<strong><em>Adult Themes and Honest Exploration of Character and the Human Experience</em></strong>- This is a story that will explore the light and the dark. Beauty and horror. While I aim to avoid being needlessly gratuitous, this story does not shy away from the horrors of war and painful psychological challenges that come with a life filled with tribulation. It will also linger in moments of connection, beauty, and peace. This is not Grimdark, though it can be dark at times.</p>
<p></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p>
<p>I drew inspiration for the Broken Path series from countless sources, but the most obvious are: Berserk, The Name of the Wind, Cradle, Dragon Heart, Dawn of Awakening, Beware of Chicken, (1,001)Arabian Nights, a broad smattering of Myths and FolkTales, and my own time spent studying and practicing martial arts and mystical traditions from across the globe (looking at you Hafiz).</p>
<p>I love Cultivation/Xianxia stories, especially when they manage to stay grounded in the plights of mortals and strong character development. This is my own personal spin set in a world of my own design inspired by the concept and mythos of the silk road as a thread that has drawn together stories from many places. I hope you enjoy reading about Ren’s journey as much as I enjoy writing it. </p>",4.61,Progression;War and Military;Xianxia;Psychological;Male Lead;Action;Adventure;Fantasy;Martial Arts;Magic;Strategy;Wuxia;Mythos

<p>Axiom of Infinity follows the story of several travelers from Earth as they attempt to make new lives for themselves in a world with monsters and dungeons, where RPG mechanics are as innate as the laws of physics, and where the gods themselves seem to be playing a very different game–one with unknown stakes and strange alliances. Blessed by two gods and cursed by another, one man finds himself at the center of their machinations, a pawn destined to become a queen.</p>
<p>This is a LitRPG Novel built on a hard system with a lot of depth and customization, but which tries not to beat you over the head with numbers constantly. In this world finding and reporting bugs and exploits is both encouraged and rewarded, and the gods have found the most qualified testers in the multiverse: Us. Now the unsuspecting natives of Astra are going to have to learn to live with a bunch of min-maxing, power-gaming, spreadsheet slinging nerds and gamers of all shapes and sizes as we do what we do best... break things.</p>

<p><br/>Thea has always dreamt of joining the United Human Federation marine corp, ever since she was saved by one of their marines at a young age in the Undercity of Lumiosia.</p>
<p>Growing up in an undercity meant however, especially in a mid-world such as Lumiosia, that she would have to work her way up from the very bottom. She would need to leave for one of the inner or core worlds, before she had any chance of applying to the UHF marines, but for that, she needed credits.</p>
<p>Having spent a lot of time in the local arcade for many years, she had accumulated a lot of technical knowledge in repairing the old-tech machines, as well as gained a high proficiency in a lot of the simulators and games featured.</p>
<p>Preparing for the monthly reset day, in which the ladders for each game get updated by the local quantum node and prizes are distributed for the top performers, she never would have anticipated a brand new challenge appearing from thin air.</p>
<p>A challenge which changed the path of her life forever...</p>

<p>The Allbright System is an Epic Sci-Fi Progression LitRPG, heavily focused on war and the military complex as a whole. It is my first publicly published Webnovel, so I am very much looking forward to read all of your feedback and suggestions.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, there will be a System that governs the major progression and LitRPG elements of the story.</p>
<p>The main draw of this story will be the way that the System interacts with each faction in the war for the galaxy, as each faction gets a unique system-trait for themselves. The nature of the traits is to be a secret until further on in the story, but rest assured that they fundamentally change the way that war in this galaxy is waged.</p>
<p>Before you start reading this story, please be aware that this will not be a short one.</p>
<p>I prefer long, expansive stories that span thousands of pages, in order to fully tell the story I intend to tell.</p>
<p>The Prologue Arc itself, which culminates in the System integration, will be 21 Chapters long (around 300-350~ pages on RR), so if you are looking for a quick and short read, this story will not be for you.</p>
<p>For everyone else, I hope you will enjoy this length journey alongside me. I plan to give readers the option to choose on developments for the story or characters at later stages, where it makes sense, so please look forward to the reader polls at those times.</p>

<p><strong>Where there is a Rune, there is a way!</strong></p>
<p>Nate is a kid from Sydney, Australia who spends his free time indulging in his one true love - art. Graffiti specifically. That is until his 'hobby' catapults him into a new world filled with danger and magic.</p>
<p>Finding himself alone in a forest that is clearly not on Earth, he must learn to navigate this new world and more importantly, the System that governs it. Armed with nothing but his trusty penknife and a Legendary Class, Nate will fend for his life. He'll conquer dungeons, discover runes and be drawn into battles against enemies he didn't even know he had, all while making new friends along the way. Torn between returning to his old life and the friends he left behind, or making a new home in this world filled with magic, he will have to decide where his heart truly lies. No matter what he chooses he'll leave his mark - and hopefully - a little art.</p>

<p>— A mix of action adventure and quieter moments with a focus on character development.</p>
<p>— A heavy focus on mystery, both with the setting and the protagonist. The main character’s backstory isn’t shared up front.</p>

<p>Rania the elf keeps emphasizing how perfectly ordinary she is, knows nothing about how society works, and seems to base half her actions on what would look the coolest in a book. She is probably just eccentric, the others reason. Perfectly ordinary behavior for a shaman. Those are always a little off.</p>
<p><strong>This story contains:</strong></p>
<p>- Adventure!<br/>- Comedy<br/>- Multiple protagonists, with switching viewpoints<br/>- Protagonists who are competent through skill and preparation<br/>- A title character who is definitely Perfectly Normal, and anyone who claims otherwise is delusional<br/>- Metafiction: There is a God of Stories who is messing with the characters<br/>- A fantasy setting based on Dungeons and Dragons, but with many unique twists: Necromancy is widely used for manual labor, Paladins work as mercenaries for whichever god pays the most, and the goddess of entropy doesn't care about killing because everyone dies eventually anyway</p>
<p><strong>Writing Style Warning:</strong></p>
<p>Some chapters are heavy on exposition that is done in an unconventional way. I spend time explaining why all the bizarre things happening are actually perfectly logical. Some people love that, while others hate it. The same chapter had these two reviews: ""I just found myself skipping most of the chapter because it was a boring info-dump"" and ""This is the most interesting explanation for a fantasy setting I have ever read and the way [the character] rambles about it really fits the theme you were going for"".</p>
<p><strong>Content Warnings:</strong></p>
<p>- One of the characters is a shapeshifter, which includes changing their sex. She is normally female and in an open relationship with a woman, but not always. Social norms regarding these kinds of things are much more accepting than in real life due to the existence of magic and for historical reasons.<br/>- Panic Attacks. Only one scene and it's comedic, but someone who suffers from this in real life might get triggered.<br/>- Arachnophobia. This content warning is not about spiders, but about Arachnophobia, which is a type of Xenophobia, and therefore speciesism. It's making Rania very sad, because people are racially prejudiced against her cute pet spider.</p>",4.67,Urban Fantasy;Post Apocalyptic;Comedy;Multiple Lead Characters;Secret Identity;Adventure;Fantasy;Mystery;Strong Lead;Magic;High Fantasy;Genetically Engineered

<p>All Lexie wanted was to go to an elite college. But life deals her a bad hand and she's transported to a new world instead, where she's the ten-year-old daughter of a once-beloved hero turned supervillain. The system wants Lexie to be a hero, but she's only focused on finding a way home.</p>
<p>Lexie’s not hero material; she’s not particularly brave or strong. Not to mention, her deck-building powers are too weak for hero work. But as an overachiever with a passion for studying, she’s confident she can ace this problem-set.</p>

This is made easy as nobody knows when or where the Prince will strike, or even why.<br/><br/>As plots collide, Jawad finds himself pressured from all sides. Aristocrats, cutthroats, and the Prince himself is breathing down his neck.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">When these two young men duel, they will set each other on a path to greatness that neither could ever imagine.

The Orc tribes gather on the horizon and other enemies lurk unseen, wishing to unseat the Legendary Sun King of Treledyne. Great heroes will clash; some will fall and others will rise.

I’ve gone deep down this rabbit hole and made cards for all the cards that show up in the book, and you’ll start seeing them in Chapter 1.

<p>In the forgotten annals of the Dark Age of Technology, a dormant bioweapon waits, its existence buried in the shadows of mankind's once-glorious past. </p>
<p>A sinister ritual, shrouded in darkness, now threatens to merge this enigmatic weapon with a soul plucked from a higher dimension and unleash Chaos upon the grimdark future of the 41st millennium.</p>
<p>But can it succeed? Or how soon will it go off the rails on the off chance that it does succeed?</p>
<p>The fate of this perilous venture hinges upon the awakening of the soul, reincarnated into an eldritch form, stranded upon a desolate world where the guiding light of the Astronomican no longer shines, surrounded by naught but the lifeless husk of the planet that stands as the memorial to all those that died to birth this being into existence.</p>
<p>What choices will it make when those who seek the bioweapon within its very being draw near? Will it fall prey to the myriads of predators stalking the stars or will those very same predators tremble in fear at the sight of this monster?</p>
<p>The future teeters on a knife's edge, awaiting the awakening of the unexpected.</p>
<hr/>
<p>At least that's what everyone else is thinking. Everyone who is not the long-dead soul of an average girl from 21st-century Earth obsessed with sci-fi as she had the dubious fortune of being yanked out of her boring afterlife and reincarnated into the body of the previously said bioweapon. </p>
<p>Follow along as she has to wrestle with both her body and soul while the dark undercurrents of the grimdark future threaten to drown this newborn Eldritch monster with a penchant for admiring herself in the mirror.</p>

<p>Extra Tags or something:</p>
<p>- The first bunch of chapters are rather rough around the edges. Might rewrite them sometime, but for now, the sub-arc dubbed 'wandering in the city' leaves some things to be desired.</p>
<p>-This is far from what I'd call a literary masterpiece, I'm trying to keep it from being fully wish fulfillment and power fantasy but balancing that and my MC not being a ragdoll for everyone in the setting is surprisingly challenging.<br/><br/></p>

<p>While it may look it at first, this is not intended as a sad story, merely an honest one.

<p>Fortunately, Su Fang is immortal. Not because he cannot die, but because when he does, he un-dies.</p>
<p>In this world, everyone is born with a Golden Finger to help them survive. Su Fang’s blessing is to return to the beginning of his journey after every death.

<p>-Detailed cultivation and crafting.</p>
<p>-Limited fighting scenes through most of the story.</p>
<p>-Slow cultivation progression. Each level will be explored in detail.</p>
<p>-Somewhat unreliable narrator. Cultivation affects the mind, and it will affect the MC’s perceptions of the world. Facts can generally be trusted, but many times there are layers beyond what the narrator sees.</p>
<p>-Xianxia tropes with a world built around them so they make sense. Why do young masters go crazy shouting ""You dare!""? Why do their guards willing throw themselves to their death against someone with significantly higher cultivation? All that and more is explained.</p>
<p>-This is a story of cultivation. It has cultivation in the xianxia sense, working to gain strength and power, but, more importantly, it is a story about cultivating the self. Finding ways to make yourself a better version of you.</p>

<p>This is not his story.</p>
<p>Standing nearby at the moment Yoshi was isekai'd was a man named Seiji - a rude, cranky, misanthropic musician who was not at all pleased to find himself also snatched up and transported to Ephemera by the goddess's wicked sister, Virya.  According to this self-proclaimed Goddess of Evil, the whole fantasy adventure thing was a game she and her sister played to stave off the boredom of immortality, and since the good goddess, Sanora, had picked her Hero...well, Virya needed a Dark Lord. </p>
<p>A grown man with his own career and ambitions, Seiji has no interest in playing.  Unfortunately for him, the call to adventure was not a request.  Now, he must conquer Ephemera and defeat the Hero...or Virya promises to make him beg for the release of death before granting it.  Playing along for his own survival, Seiji nonetheless is under no illusions who his true enemy is, and it's not the naive young would-be Hero from his own world.</p>
<p>Placed in an impossible position, Seiji must make enough progress toward world domination to keep his sadistic patron goddess off his back, but not so much that he can't strike an accord with the forces of Good and convince the Hero Yoshi that it's the goddesses who are their mutual enemy.  Forced to embrace Evil without being <em>too</em> evil, Seiji walks the razor's edge, building his forces and biding his time till he can get revenge on the goddesses and be free of them, his only certainty that he will not be getting out of this with his hands clean.</p>

<hr/>
<p><em>Rank 1 description: (minimum met for system initialization...detailed description as follows)</em></p>
<p>Each race was given a system by the gods to make up for their shortcomings and balance their place in this world.</p>
<p>Humans: Abysmally bad at understanding and using magic unable to use more than the lowest of magic were given the ""Skill System"" magic in the form of premade skills with use, study, and mastery tied to experience.</p>
<p>Elves: Intuitively understand magic and have long lives leading to vast knowledge and skill in their chosen fields. However, as a species, they have nearly zero sex drive and less than low fertility, so they were gifted the ""World Tree System"" with experience gained through the care of natural areas – gifting the chance of children to increase their numbers without dirty copulation.</p>
<p>All “natural” or “wild” monsters are given an ""Evolution system"" designed around killing and consuming as many creatures as possible, slowly increasing strength and, at thresholds, allowing mutations to alter them multiple times.</p>
<p>Dungeon cores are different. Unlike humans, they can see, manipulate and live off mana. Unlike Elves, they naturally crystallize after extended periods of time in high mana level areas. However, they cannot easily move or communicate and typically go insane without companionship. As a species other than the odd eccentric they are unimaginative. Brute forcing solutions without the drive to truly innovate. Thus they have been gifted with the ""Dungeon Connection System"" a magical version of the internet accessible by their peers that allows them to barter and sell: bait, traps, monsters, and knowledge, as well as entertain each other with “adventure streams” using exciting recorded battles and humorous reels of arrogant chumps biting off more than they can chew to often fatal effects.</p>
<p>This is the casual story of a dungeon unluckily spawned far from potential adventurers forced to innovate beyond its peers to find its place in this world.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Rank 2 Description: Justification.</em></p>
<p>I've been on a dungeon core kick for months and while I love the genre – it's sparse with entries.</p>
<p>Often the forced conflict gets repetitive and frantic solving of threats ""power levels"" the protagonist to god levels to progress the plot – taking away the nice steady progression fantasy I'm looking for. (Progression in this story is linked to how strong of monsters/traps/whatever he can create not his ""level""...this is demonstrated by some of his newer monsters beating his older monsters not with discrete ""this monster has 10 attack this one has 40"")</p>
<p>Additionally, the focus on 3rd parties with their drama takes away from the reason I’m reading dungeon core novels in the first place – I'm looking for magical crafting, experimentation and kingdom building – not defence from higher and higher levelled enemies looking to steal/destroy/control the MC. </p>
<p>This novel is kind of just me writing the story I wish I could read. I like thinking about the experimentation that can be done in fantasy settings using 'mana' as an excuse to make up rules and try to keep them internally consistent. IE once I define how a rule works, I'm going to commit to keeping it – no breaking hard truths I've given when it's convenient, even if it backs me into a corner. Hopefully, that should make the story interesting to read even if it's SOL and less action-oriented.</p>
<p>There will be problems to solve and a clear progression in strength (of created monsters and knowledge) however due to not wanting to force conflict for the sake of conflict the general theme will be closer to slice of life with few action sequences and no overarching goal so please keep that in mind when picking this up as the genre is not for everyone.</p>
<p>Finally, I have a clear goal of what I want from this story (not an endless romp but a series of arcs and then a conclusion that's a couple of dozen medium-sized chapters long) I want to commit to finishing it or at least bringing it to a point of rest. I hate all the engaging stories that stop with a “hiatus” indefinitely so in the event I lose motivation I'll work to end this even if the ending becomes rushed/unsatisfying just to give a sense of closure.</p>
<p>I’m planning on including several polls in terms of direction and taking feedback heavily into account if I get enough readers (but may choose to ignore it if it deviates too far from the direction I want to take this as in feedback like: “The MC needs a cartoonishly evil arch-enemy that wants to enslave him and force the mc to pump out magic items” or “the MC needs to make a body and learn teleportation then live with humans” will get shot down without consideration.)</p>",4.57,LitRPG;Dungeon;Non-Human Lead;Slice of Life;Fantasy;Reader Interactive;Magic;High Fantasy;Progression

<p>Out on the frontier of a new continent, the wizard Lori and her group of settlers try to build a community for themselves in a land actively hostile to intelligent life. With their wits, their will, and their newly built Dungeon to protect them against the Iridescence, the deadly growth that makes life inhospitable beyond the borders of their demesne, they should be fine.

<p>Using structural engineering, the scientific method, the comparative advantages of stone and ice as building materials, logistics, the dark and terrible art of personnel management (outsourced to more experienced individuals), and her own magic and experience, Lori and her newly dubbed lord Rian must face the persistent problems of shelter, sanitation, drinking water, morale, transport, food storage, material collection and refinement, and keeping horny idiots from fucking everywhere they shouldn't.</p>

<p><strong>[I died and was accidentally reborn as an angelic monstrosity, so now I’m building a holy dungeon-tower that is tall enough to reach the gods; so that I can complain about it! But the humans think that I am trying to destroy the world.]</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>The senselessness of so much of the world’s death and suffering is made apparent to the dying paladin, Isaiah, in his final moments before he perishes and is, shortly thereafter, reborn into a comparatively quiet and peaceful existence as a simple blackbird.</p>
<p>However, the powerful magic of the god whom Isaiah himself had served in his prior human life upends this latest existence, as a spell goes awry, turning the entity instead into a strange, angelic monstrosity that is neither man nor animal.</p>
<p>Isaiah, desperate to return to its simple life as a blackbird, sets out to build the tallest tower ever seen by the eyes of the world in order to reach the reclusive gods who reside in the heavens above and make them undo the transformation in a bid to allow itself an escape from the complex suffering of intelligent, self-aware mortality.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">When Tori woke, she was in a lavish four poster bed with a splitting headache and in the bruised teenage body of a Marquis' arrogant daughter from the popular dating sim ""The Romance of Soleil"".   </span></p>

<p>We really did.</p>
<p>We tried<em> so hard </em>to be… better…</p>
<p>We actually were <em>better </em>once. No, seriously. We were enlightened, generous, peaceful…</p>
<p>Stop laughing! We were! We were <em>peaceful,</em> dammit!</p>
<p>No, I’m not “tugging your winglets.” It’s true!</p>
<p>Look, if you’re going to be like that, I’ll just push the launch button right now. See ya, don’t wanna be…</p>
<p>Oh, you ARE interested after all? Ok.</p>
<p>Hey, I just got word that your captain will be ok. We were able to get him into a med pod quick enough… Of course, we tried to save him. Just what sort of people do you think we are?...</p>
<p>Now that was harsh… completely accurate, mind you… but harsh.</p>
<p>Anyway, like I was saying, we were a prosperous, <em>peaceful</em> people, and war had been nothing but a distant memory for over five hundred years before it happened...</p>
<p>Before Yellowstone happened! You don’t mean to tell me that you didn’t know about that… Massive supervolcano? Blew the Hell out of our planet? Two years where nothing grew?…</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s what started it, the Sol Wars…</p>
<p>Oh, you <em>have</em> heard about those, huh? Well, needless to say, all that enlightened, generous, and peaceful didn’t exactly make it through that. Maybe it’s more accurate to say the enlightened, generous, and peaceful among us didn’t survive…</p>
<p>(laughs)… You’re right. It <em>does</em> explain a lot, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Probably for the best, though. “Enlightened” and “peaceful” aren’t really all that useful out here in the galaxy, are they? We're not the only jerks out here. We aren't the worst ones, either, not by a long shot.</p>
<p>That reminds me, thanks for the ship. It's really nice. Oh, don’t be like that. At least it was us what got you and not one of the really messed groups like the Harlequin or the Black Angels. We’re just going to take your shit. It could be worse… <em>trust me</em>...</p>
<p>Well, anyway, we loaded the life pods down with some good food, and you guys can drink alcohol, right? We put in a couple of fifths in there, too. It’s about forty percent ethanol, so be warned.  We’ll drop your wounded off somewhere safe once they are stable.</p>
<p>Your fleet patrols this area fairly regularly, and we’ll drop the distress beacon right before we jump…</p>

<p>It’s the thirty-second century, and humanity is now part of a galactic civilization comprised of hundreds of worlds. Humanity has been savaged by natural disaster and war and has been fractured into several separate populations, all of which loathe each other (some things never change). This is a gritty drama-driven rambling tale that swings between action, drama, horror, and plenty of very, very dark comedy.</p>
<p>Warning: contains adult situations, absolutely horrible language, bathroom humor, implied ultra-violence, actual ultra-violence, drugs, alcohol, pirates, mercs, xeno prostitutes, moral ambiguity, deranged AI's with identity issues, giant commie space slugs, and a poor little frog girl who just wants to sell coffee.</p>

<p><span>Those warning tags on top? Yeah... They aren't for show. This story can get pretty dark. It's not a ""grimdark"" slog through gore, but it does have its moments. I don' t pull punches and some heavy/contentious issues are involved sometimes. Please bear in mind that this is a work of fiction and just because a character, even a main or sympathetic one, does something or endorses something, the author is NOT endorsing it.

<p><span>A cyborg transhuman escapes her corporate indenture and through unfathomably unlikely circumstances, she ends up in a fantasy world of full of unique magic, angry people with sharp implements, and the whole flavor-spectrum of divine entities. Hilarity ensues. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Features:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>- No blue boxes or cultivation, this is not a LitRPG nor about martial arts</span></p>
<p><span>- Hard-ish Sci-Fi meets hard-ish magic  </span></p>
<p><span>- Generally trying to keep this ""rational""</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rationale:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>My primary goal with <em>The Cosmic Interloper </em>is to <em>write something that I myself would enjoy reading. </em>Of course, that’s not the only motivation, but I think it’s the most important one for me to keep in mind, especially as the author. In fact, this whole story came about because after consuming oodles of fiction, I found myself craving a very specific type of story which I couldn’t find many examples of. Then I asked myself, “why not write it myself?” and here we are. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In general, while I’m not writing a comedy, I do intend for this story to be funny and a bit wacky or absurd. That said though, I am using this story as a vehicle to explore some potentially dark topics including (but not limited to) slavery, speciesism/racism, and existential questions of self, consciousness, and identity. Still, I’m going to leave the “traumatizing content” tags off, because I don’t feel that what I’ve written so far (or plan on writing) exceeds the threshold that would be necessary for me to tag it thusly.</span></p>
<p>Also, [insert your favorite boilerplate “views expressed” disclaimer here]. I shouldn’t need to say this, but the main character can be <em>wrong</em> on occasion (gasp!) and the way she views the world is not the objective truth (if such a thing even exists).</p>",4.61,Portal Fantasy / Isekai;Strategy;Psychological;Non-Human Lead;Sci-fi;Adventure;Fantasy;Female Lead;Strong Lead;Secret Identity;Magic;Genetically Engineered;Technologically Engineered;Hard Sci-fi;Artificial Intelligence

Vix soon finds herself fleeing for her life and her freedom, fleeing to the faraway city of Floria on an island ruled by the mysterious Nurass, Prince of Shadows. In Floria, Vix's sharp mind and talent for magic land her a spot at the Perdita Free Collegium, the world's greatest school for spies, saboteurs, swashbucklers, seductresses and, some claim, practitioners of dark magic... and that suits Vix just fine. If the Collegium wants to give Vix the tools she needs to save her family and get her revenge on Duke Orso, she'll take that deal any day of the week and twice on Saintsdays, even if that means making a deal with the Prince of Shadows himself.

<p><strong><br/>Welcome to Five Kingdoms of Cordizal!</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400""></span></p>
<p><strong><br/>What is the Five Kingdoms of Cordizal?</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">I often get asked this type of question about my stories by friends, bloggers, and potential readers.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">The Five Kingdoms of Cordizal is a high-fantasy epic universe that is the setting for most of my stories. The foundation of the universe is its multicultural, multiracial setting with several sentient races attempting to carve their legacy and survive. The world is fully fleshed out and vibrant with a rich and mysterious history not based on Tolkien mythology.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">This brings me to magic. To me, magic is an essential part of the fantasy genre, so, of course, there is magic in the Five Kingdoms universe. However, one critical part of the Five Kingdoms universe is that magic is an abundant commodity that is a part of everyday life and not some plot device used to drive the story.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">In short, the Five Kingdoms universe is the setting of epic fantasy stories with deep characters and world-building. I try to tell as many different types of stories as possible in the universe, and hopefully, you can find something for you in it.</span></p>",4.81,Female Lead;Strong Lead;Drama;Adventure;Fantasy;Mystery;Supernatural;Magic;High Fantasy

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Seven years ago, the Frozen Flame brought magic to Earth—but not to Dalton, who gained only scars. Now a lonely shut-in, “Ezzen” has resigned himself to an online life of secondhand magic, dabbling in magical theory and fanboying over the Spire and its superhuman Vaetna, the paragons of this new era.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">So when fate splinters and magic finds him, it’s the best day of his life—and the worst, as he suddenly becomes a resource in the cold war over control of magical power. From paramilitary organizations to Flame-worshipping cults to incandescent magical girls, the forces of the world sense the ripples and close in.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Worse, his escape exposes the awful secret of the Flame, the thing quietly omitted from all the theory: that instead of the apotheosis he’s dreamt of, the reality of being a flamebearer is cruel and twisted, the bloody path of monsters. And some of those monsters are so very similar to the Vaetna he idolizes.</span></p>

<p><span><br/>After living decades and dying hundreds of times, Kegan has learned that he has finally passed some test that the cruel spirit had given him. Now, Kegan has the ability to gain “perks” that can make his life much easier. He is looking forward to finally having an easy life with the new perks he has earned.</span><br/><br/></p>
<hr/>
<p><span>Rules to keep me honest for the perk system:<br/></span></p>
<div>
<div><strong>Spoiler</strong>: Spoiler</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>1. The purpose of perks is to help the MC live longer and do new things each life.</div>
<div>2. The perks can be unlocked by getting hurt or killed.</div>
<div>3. The perks can be unlocked by putting in a lot of effort that isn’t easily duplicated in a new life.</div>
<div>4. Perks are generally beneficial enhancements to the MC’s body.</div>
<div>5. Perk costs can be lowered with more impressive achievements to unlock them.</div>
<div>6. Perk costs can be lowered by repeated death or injury from something the perk protects against.</div>
<div>7. Perk costs are increased for quality of life improvements that don’t benefit survival.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I want to avoid one of the pitfalls I see for other LitRPG stories where the game elements barely relate to the story, or offer very little information. If people are skipping over and not reading the perks then I'm doing things wrong. So I promise to try and make the perks interesting, sometimes humorous, informative, and relevant to the story.<br/><br/>Cover art by http://dertypaws.com/</p>",4.54,GameLit;Reincarnation;Strategy;Male Lead;Strong Lead;Action;Adventure;Fantasy;High Fantasy

<p>Allison is a normal girl who enjoys spending time with her friends, going out to parties and clubs, and just generally enjoying college life. So when she wakes up in a strange underground complex full of candles, weird creatures, and no memory of how she ended up there, it's safe to say she's a little out of her element. She has no survival skills, no ability to fight, and absolutely no hecking clue what all these weird words and numbers floating around in her head are supposed to mean! It seems like a hopeless situation until, in her desperation, she finds an unlikely ally in...herself?! Another her with different knowledge, skills, and personality. Together, they might have a chance of making it out alive, but there's a catch—they still share the same body.</p>

<p>What to expect:</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm not doing that. <em>System Lost</em> is my second series, and my first new project after four years of writing my previous story, <em>Fates Parallel</em>. I've learned a lot from that experience, and I'm excited to put those lessons to work in this new story. If you're familiar with my previous work, then you can expect a familiar focus on characterization and personal growth, with a newly refined style and brand new themes and setting. If not, then just know that I've spent the last four years consistently writing one story until it was finished, with only a handful of pauses each less than a month long. I am committed to seeing my projects through to the end, and I offer proof rather than promises that this story will not be abandoned.</p>
<p>Additionally, I plan to keep <em>System Lost</em> freely available for as long as possible, or even indefinitely if I can afford to do so. I'm not going to make a promise I might have to break, but it is my sincere hope that I will not ever have move this story to Kindle Unlimited.</p>

<p>John, a 37-year-old widower, is feeling lost. Grief, regrets, and the weight of the past make him long for something new, something different. So when he finds a way to travel between worlds using dimensional Gates, he takes it. A bit of research, a bit of training, and he’s off.</p>
<p>Sure, his class has the potential to be overpowered, but he’s not in it for fights, fame, or power. He’s here to breathe again. To heal. To see what else is out there. He moves at his own pace, helps out when he wants—sometimes as a healer, sometimes as something else—and keeps track of it all in a sort of diary. It’s more about the journey than the destination. About magic, new places, and figuring out how to live again.</p>
<p>This isn’t some dark, gritty tale full of battles or world-ending stakes. It’s about traveling with friends. Awkward conversations, food, understanding magic, and way too much shopping. It’s about the little things that make life worth it—and how even small discoveries can change everything.</p>
<p>Scattered through the story are short side stories—glimpses into other worlds, other travelers, or the consequences of his actions. They all circle back eventually, adding layers to John’s path and filling in the bigger picture, one quiet step at a time.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Book 1: Shimoor</strong><br/>The first book follows John’s journey in Shimoor, a low-mana world with a medieval society where magic is barely noticeable. This “tutorial world” provides John with the calm, slow pace he needs to begin his journey, allowing him to adjust to the freedom of world-hopping without pressure or danger.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Book 2: Back on Earth</strong><br/>In the second book, John returns to Earth. With fresh eyes and a traveler’s mindset, he experiences Earth like a new world, focusing on friendship and personal growth. This time, he reconnects with the marvels of Earth—exploring familiar places as though they are foreign. A significant portion of the story focuses on John’s adventures in shopping, discovering new things to buy, and indulging in what Earth has to offer. Yes, John does <em>a lot</em> of shopping.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Book 3: Lumis</strong><br/>The third book takes John to Lumis, a medium-mana world with dungeons and captivating places. For the first time, he travels purely for the sake of exploration, eager to experience a new world and its mysteries, without any specific goal other than discovery and enjoyment.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Book 4: Zindor - Spoils of a Shattered World</strong></p>
<p>Recently integrated, Zindor is a dangerous world where uncleared dungeons and unchecked monsters dominate the wilds. People live in fear, sheltered behind fortified walls, as a tense political landscape adds to the chaos. John and his friends must navigate not only the deadly wilderness but also the volatile politics of the cities, where every decision could mean the difference between survival and disaster in this unforgiving world.</p>
<hr/>
<p>So kick back, relax with a coffee or snack, and take a break from reality. Join John, the Gate Traveler, on a never-ending vacation.</p>

<p>Eunora Dawn is just a child. She was born a noble in the kingdom of Maeve, with 5 siblings and a shy personality. At a glance, her life was meant to be rosy.</p>
<p>But, when Eunora unlocks the [System] on her 8th birthday, she gains more than she expected. Memories of her past life as a strong-willed and fulfilled woman flood her mind and all but overwrite her personality. Filled with existential dread and grief over losing her past loved ones, Eunora goes from an innocent child filled with hope for her family to someone who is just trying to keep herself afloat in a strange world that almost seems too awful to be true.</p>
<p>With her sudden change in personality, as two individuals become one within Eunora, she has to find something she cares about. Anything. As long as it gets her out of bed.</p>
<p>Eunora loved her life in the Before -and she’s not looking forward to growing up <em>again</em>. All Maeve has shown her is neglect and longing, and after living a life of privilege, she’ll need to adjust.</p>

It's technically a <strong>Xianxia</strong> (because cultivators!), but it also veers towards <strong>Xuanhuan </strong>and has more traditional <strong>High Fantasy</strong> elements and a bit of <strong>Gods and Monsters</strong> and <strong>All Myths Are</strong> (on some levels) <strong>Valid</strong>. It also has a<strong> fairly large, ensemble cast</strong>, so if <strong>multiple point's of view</strong> are <em>not </em>your thing I am sorry.  It won't ever really be considered <em>'grimdark' </em>by any real measure of that definition but it does go to some complicated and fairly dark places occasionally, which I will note in author pre-chapter notes when expedient!<br/>I have updated the tags to account for recent changes to the RR definitions. 'Disturbing Content' now has a <em>much </em>broader definition, so i have added the tag, but significant instances within the story are noted in chapter-blurbs. Also, Portal Fantasy Hyoooo~!</p>

<p>The land of Gemeinplatz is a land filled with fantastical creatures, adventurers looking to slay them, and heroes looking to distinguish themselves from the adventurers. The most common of these heroes are those who come from Earth, who enjoy a most leisurely time with their cheat skills. It’s a perfect world, the utopia of those who wish to become overpowered and get their own power fantasy, where even the most everyman of the everyman can pull themselves by their bootstraps and become a hero.</p>
<p>Yet, underneath this “Gemeinplatzer Dream” is a disgusting truth.</p>
<p>To satisfy the needs of heroes who can’t find function like a normal human being (which most of them can’t), the lucrative Gemeinplatz slave trade crushes the dreams and ruins the lives of hundreds every day. These slaves endlessly labor, in the harems of so-called heroes, at the mansions of the landowning “heroes”, and as rare materials for various dubious magical spells.</p>
<p>In a world that looks down at them as demi-human, where the ruling class has no incentive to end this profitable trade, in which their oppressors are overpowered as all hell, what hope is there for the slaves?</p>
<p>What hope is there, is named John Brown. This time, he’ll finish what he started.</p>

A Dungeon Core is born from a wayward soul. It seeks power and agency, and works to accumulate wealth to fuel its power, in turn using this power to accumulate further wealth. Inevitably, the mind is lost as desperation and ambition drive it to commit darker and darker acts. Shortly thereafter, the adventurers arrive to quell the core.</p>
<p>This is a tale that has repeated itself countless times throughout history: all cores desire power. And yet, this core seems to have it backwards.</p>
<p>It doesn't want to rule the world. It has no desire to enslave or conquer.</p>
<p>No, this core doesn't want to be a warlord, a villain, or a tyrant.</p>
<p>It wants to start a core-poration. </p>

Ancient cities, abandoned starships, temples and fortified bunkers all contain artefacts and devices far in advance of what humans have been able to produce.

<p>The rewards are high, but you have to be prepared to go further and risk more to discover the greatest secrets of a civilisation that vanished long before the first human walked upright. Secrets that could irrevocably change humanity's future, or end it.</p>

<p><strong>…but the xenos still worship them as GODS.</strong></p>
<p>Today, hundreds of alien civilizations thrive in the gods’ lost cities and fallen megastructures. One Empire has learned to harness the remains of humanity's forgotten technology to reconnect the distant worlds... and dominate them.</p>
<p><strong>Eolh is an old, jaded, avian thief</strong> who lives in the dark underbelly of a conquered city. When the Empire first opened the gate between worlds, they stormed his home, killed his gang, and burned everything he held dear.</p>
<p>But that was a long time ago.</p>
<p>Now, the resistance is dead. No one dreams of fighting back—for the Empire wields the weapons of the gods: warships that fly, robotic constructs that hunt, and rare mysteries scavenged from the tombs of the gods. Eolh lives a half-life, thieving, running jobs, and selling his services as a freelance listener for the last gangs of Lowtown. He trusts no one, and only looks out for himself.</p>
<p>When an unusual heist takes a deadly turn, Eolh must bargain with an overzealous android who carries an impossible secret—one that will shake the foundations of the universe.</p>
<p>There is one last hope for salvation. For his people, or maybe just for himself…</p>

<p>Author's Comment:</p>
<p>I was asked about reading my work on other sites. The answer is simple: Currently, I am not active in any other networks than royalroadl.com. Only here, I correct mistakes and errors. If you read it anywhere else and have to pay for it or have to deal with an annoying amount of advertisement, You Are Being Betrayed. You would do good if you make other people in that network aware of it. This is a free project of mine for the purpose of having fun. And if people try to make money with it you shouldn't bother visiting their website. The only one whom I actually allowed to have my work on his website is Armaell who invested the time to compile them into pdf.

25225,Delve,delve,True,Hiatus,2024-12-10T06:00:04.0000000+00:00,21719,4712,22399387,"<p><strong>Summary – Level 1</strong>:</p>
<p>Delve is an isekai litrpg that follows an average guy who just happened to wake up in a forest one day. He wasn’t summoned to defeat the demon lord or to save the world or anything like that, at least as far as he can tell. The only creature there to greet him was a regular old squirrel.</p>
<p>Soon enough, he meets other people, only to discover that he can’t speak the language, and that not everybody immediately trusts random pajama-wearing strangers they met in the middle of the wilderness. Things generally go downhill from there, at least until the blue boxes start appearing.</p>
<p>Delve is a story about finding your way in a new, strange, and dangerous world. It’s about avoiding death, figuring out what the heck is going on, and trying to make some friends along the way. It’s not about getting home, so much as finding a new one.</p>
<p>Did I mention that there will be math?</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> <strong>Summary – Level 2</strong>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p> Okay, but what are you in for, really?</p>
<p>Well, this story is supposed to be realistic, or at least, as realistic as a fantasy litrpg can be. The main character doesn’t instantly become an all-powerful god and murder-hobo his way across the universe. Delve is, at its heart, a progression fantasy, but that progression is meant to feel earned. The numbers in this story actually mean something. Everything is calculated, and if you find a rounding error, I expect you to tell me about it. That said, if math isn’t your cup of tea, there is plenty more that the story has to offer. Characters are meant to feel real, and progression isn’t only about personal power; it’s also about allies, connections, and above all, knowledge. Figuring out how the system works is a significant theme.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What, you want more details? Okay, fine, but this is going to get a bit spoiler-y. Are you sure?</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<div><strong>Yes!</strong></div>
<div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p>Really sure? I mean, this summary is practically half as long as the first chap–</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<div><strong>Now!</strong></div>
<div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p>Okay, okay!</p>
<p>The main character becomes a magic user, but he takes a route that is not very popular in adventurer culture, namely that of a support. There is a full magic system with various spells, skills, and abilities, but our MC decides that aura magic is the way to go, and that the only stat worth investing in is mana regeneration. Most people at the Adventurer’s Guild think that this makes him a bit of a dumbass, but he’s playing the long game. We’ll see how that works out for him, won’t we?</p>
<p>Because of his build, the MC levels up fast, at least compared to normal people. There are no cheats, though, and he is limited in other ways. There are some clear and pretty obvious downsides to his build. That’s what makes it fun, no?</p>
<p>Morals? Our MC has them. Again, we’ll see how that works out for him. Realism, remember? Would you be okay with killing someone and looting their body? I sure hope not.</p>
<p>POV? The focus is on the main character, but there will be occasional varying perspectives from people around him, or involved in the events related to the main plot. It isn’t going to jump all over the place.</p>
<p>Tech is standard medieval stasis. No smartphones, but the MC does have a technical background. Computers and their programming might be involved. There might even be a bit of uplifting down the road, who knows? Anyway, it isn’t the focus. He isn’t going to invent the gun in chapter 1 and change the face of warfare.</p>
<p>Romance is not a major focus. Friendships are more the name of the game, though there will be some characters in romantic relationships.</p>
<p>There is exploration, though not as much of the geographical nature as you might expect. It is more about exploration of the system and the culture.</p>
<p>The pace is slow and detailed, sometimes verging on slice-of-life. The action is meant to be realistic and grounded in the numbers, and it is intended to have meaning beyond simply punching things until they stop moving.</p>
<p>The general tone of the story is grey, and some parts can get quite dark. People die. Sometimes, people with names, but not anywhere near GoT level. There is plenty of light, too, though, to balance the darkness. The world is dangerous, but overcoming that danger is why we’re all here, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Anyway, if you’ve made it this far through the summary, you clearly like words. I hope you enjoy the story!</p>

<p>Luck Lockyer was the type of man to smirk in the dark, the expression not for anyone but himself. One of perpetual amusement. The bright side of things were hard to find in the shade yet his amber eyes were always searching. The smirk was his default, he knew it, his friends knew it, his family knew it. It was his most natural state.</p>
<p>But the death of everyone close to you can affect a downwards curve on the mouths of even the most stoic people.</p>
<p>Without purpose, without anyone to do the job for, Luck Lockyer found himself inside an empty forgotten church. The perpetual smirk on his face had slipped to a thin line, his scar more noticeable now than ever before. His amber eyes, the windows to his soul, dull and lifeless. To anyone who knew him, it was the clothing that gave away his mental state, denim pants and a plain black t-shirt. If that wasn't enough, the tears running down his face certainly would, the echoing sobs of a broken man rang across the rundown church.</p>
<p>It was on a whim, but Luck Lockyer prayed, he prayed for many things, for death, revenge, friends, but the one prayer dominating his thoughts, a second chance for his family.</p>
<p>That was all he wanted. Simple.</p>
<p>It was then, on the outskirts of a polluted city, in an abondoned lot, in a forgotten church that Luck Lockyer, the Devil of the Cards, the Bloodless Hand, the Amber Demon, the Broken, was answered by a being from another world and one from his.</p>

<p>Good things come to those who wait. Damien Vale didn't, and now he's bound to an Eldritch creature from beyond the farthest reaches of the universe. It's unfathomable, utterly evil, and likes to be called Henry. To Damien, none of that mattered. He was going to learn magic, and he'd be damned if he let something as small as this set him back. </p>
<p>When Damien started his first year at a mage college, he didn't expect it to be easy. However, when he's assigned to room with a strange girl that has magic that even Henry is wary of, Damien realizes things might not be so easy. He sets out to accomplish his life goal of becoming a powerful mage, all the while dealing with a murderous professor, an eldritch creature that's created a persona to act like a teenager, and a new roomate that's far more perceptive than he'd like.</p>
<p>As Damien struggles to deal with the ramifications of the monster within him, a disturbing fact comes to life: Henry might not be the only eldritch creature on the mortal plane, and he's the only one that can stop them. </p>

<p>NOTE: This story is  progression fantasy with some very basic litRPG elements (such as a wristband that shows a character's stats). It is <strong>not </strong>a full on litRPG - it's a progression fantasy story with litRPG elements. The story will contain some romance, but it will not be explicit nor will it take over the story.

<p>- Though the story is not a comedy, the tone is mostly light, and it contains humorous elements.</p>
<p>- There is some romance between side characters. There are no current plans for the MC to have a love interest. Just to be clear (and I'm only mentioning this because it's the internet and ... people), there is absolutely no possibility that the sixty-year-old isekai'd protagonist will develop a romantic relationship with any of his teenage disciples.

He lived in the small town of Kinon (called Kinney by locals) with his wife, Kahriah and his son, Thesdon. The story begins with him alone and unable to travel more than a few hundred miles from his home. For 5 years he tried to chart his prison until one day a letter appears with a mysterious commission that will see him test his condition and his boundary. <br/><br/>Set roughly 50 years before the impending end of days (from Loot canon), The Painter is a story about loss, grit, and exploration of a seemingly normal man in a world of magic and monsters. The Painter will follow the man on his adventure to restore his family, uncover his commissioners and discover the nature of his condition. <br/><br/>Loot is the decentralized, global, community built fantasy world based on Dom Hoffman's art/tech experiment: Loot. <br/><br/>Fun fact: The cover of our book is painted by the artist, who the MC is loosely based on and the same person painting the Banners (digitally) IRL for an art/worldbuilding project. </p>",4.67,Psychological;Tragedy;Fantasy;Mystery;Magic;High Fantasy

You would do good if you make other people in that network aware of it. This is a free project of mine for the purpose of having fun.

What was it? ~“Oh, he fought. He fought a lot. And no thing could escape his power. It was something that everyone had to live with.”~ So he became a hero and changed the world? ~“…”~ Tell me. ~“Nooo, that's not how the story goes.

<p><span>The humans call me Nemon Fargus.  They call me wizard, and [Elementalist] and [Enchanter].  They call me teacher.  They call me adventurer.  </span></p>
<p><span>But I don't care.  Not anymore.  For more than a hundred and fifty years I've served the Kingdom of Sena.  Through four Kings and a Queen.  Two wars and a rebellion.  I've founded and taught at a magic school.  I've fought against beast waves and dungeon breaks.</span></p>
<p><span>But now?  Now, the one close friend I had left has passed.  So, I'm done with their politics and their economics.  The short and busy lives of humans are more burden than benefit on the weary soul of this half-elf.  Now, I'm looking for a refuge, a place that can well and truly be my own.  Away from the growing cities and the bustling markets, away from the pointless wars, away from the eager students and the arrogant adventurers.  It's too much.  </span></p>
<p><span>I'm seeking the peaceful life of a wizard in his tower, studying magic to advance my spellcraft.  We'll see if that happens.</span></p>

<p><strong>In a world of countless enemies, the right talent is all it takes to thrive. </strong></p>
<p><span>Freddy Stern, a twenty-one-year-old cashier, has lived a plain, albeit harsh life. Having been orphaned—twice—he's spent the last ten years working and staying out of trouble. His only aspiration is to save enough money to become an archhuman.</span></p>
<p><span>His dream gets the jump on him when he barely survives a near-death encounter and finds himself with 1% Lifesteal, a bizarre talent with numerous contradictions and just as many uses.</span></p>
<p><span>With every dead enemy, he becomes a bit stronger, a little wiser, and a lot more ruthless. And no matter how much damage he takes, he can always put himself back together. Physically, at least.</span></p>
<p><span>But on his path to power, after having to look at the rotting guts of archhuman society again and again, can his talent keep his mind and soul as pristine as his body?</span></p>

<p>In the far reaches of the Autumn Lands, a young man named Kite takes his first steps on a journey into a wider world.

Growing through the bonds he forge and tempered by the trials he endure, it will be up to him to find his place in a world where individual power is the ultimate measure of a person. Because there are monsters lurking the frontier lands, many even bearing the masks of men. </p>
<p>The story takes place on Pallimustus, the alternate world from He Who Fights With Monsters, an original story written by Shirtaloon.

<p>- A coming-of-age story</p>
<p>- More essences and powers. (Some liberties have been taken in inventing or adding new ones, but I have tried keeping them in lines with the resources of the official Discord server)</p>
<p><strong>What to not expect from this story:</strong></p>
<p>- The wider cosmos</p>
<p>- A loner MC only focusing on personal power</p>
<p>- <span>Harems (given the inspiration for the setting, I felt that this should be specified.)</span></p>

<hr/>
<p>I guess I'm a dragon now. That's just the kind of thing that can screw up a girl's whole month.</p>
<p>I took a bad fall while exploring a cave. When I got out, I found the world, and myself, changed beyond recognition. We didn't have any monsters back home, unless you count the spiders. And claws and teeth, wings and a tail, horns and scales, all those are going to take some getting used to. So is hunting for my meals and fighting to survive.</p>
<p>But I won't give up. I'm going to fight to live, and to stay myself. The one I share my mind with, she knows just what to do, and as long as I don't go along with her worst impulses we should be fine. And my new body is strong. In fact, it's practically magical, since even a little dragon is a force of nature. I'll figure things out. I'll make a life for myself.</p>
<p>And I'll grow my hoard, of course. Greed is good. Gold is everything. </p>
<hr/>
<p>Draka is a story about making your own place in a world that fears you, for good reasons or bad. It's a story that often takes the long way around, and has been quite fairly described as ""meandering"" and ""litRPG-lite."" You can expect slow power progression based on greed and hoarding, a mix of adventure and slice-of-life, and a draconic main character who struggles to hang on to her humanity.</p>

<p>Secret Abdication is a LitRPG fantasy adventure I'm writing for writathon. It's based on an idea I've had for a while so hopefully I can keep up the pace!! There will be archery, sword fumbling, systems, murder most foul, doubles, levelling, cynical middle aged men who think they are old men, well meaning older brothers, classes, amused older sisters, carpentry, doubles, cross-dressing, dramatic reveals, doubles, romance and silly songs and more doubles. </p>
<p>Timing is both good and bad - I'm off to hospital tomorrow so have a day to write as much as I can and then there will be a break but then I have all that boring recovery time off work to try and motor through some more!</p>

<p>He’ll have to face a society focused on self-improvement and cooperation.  Suffer the horror of competent administration.  Persevere through the indignity of living in a world where people’s opinions are based on rational arguments. </p>
<p>Although Nero’s past life hadn’t prepared him for the challenges he’ll face, he won’t face them alone.  He will find allies to assist him, mentors to guide him, even a few fans.  There will be villains and threats, heroes and training.  But mostly, it will be Nero trying to ignore what’s going on around him while focusing on learning magic.</p>
<p>The world is big, and there are characters aplenty.  As time goes on, the story will grow.  The leveling system may seem simple at first, but it's soon revealed to be so complex that our hero will do everything he can to ignore it, regardless of the consequences.</p>
<p>If you enjoy watching an internet troll with a heart of fool's gold be forced to grow up by circumstance and the influence of those around him, then this story will be worth your time.  Just don't get your hopes up, our main character isn't ready for that kind of responsibility.</p>

Then the System arrived, bringing with it magic, Rifts, and the chance for ordinary people to become extraordinary. Unfortunately for Alex, his stats started out as unimpressive as his old life. But when he gains the unique trait {Primordial Will}, which only allows him to put his free points into one stat, everything changes—though not necessarily for the better.</p>
<p>Thrown into a dangerous Rift way above his pay grade, Alex quickly discovers that surviving the chaos isn't just about having powerful skills.

<p>This series follows Alex as he begins to master the art of <em>Mana Threads</em> and creates a revolutionary new magic system with <em>Spell Circles.</em> He starts to realize that magic isn’t just a tool—it’s a path to power that few can fully grasp. But with the world’s governments struggling to contain the rising number of superhuman threats, Alex will have to navigate more than just monsters and Rifts.

<p><em>[ BOOK 1 - LEGACY OF THE BROKEN ] SYNOPSIS:<br/></em></p>
<p><em>In the depths of a broken galaxy, a Patriarch leads an expedition into the heart of ruined space.</em><br/><em>A terrible war ensnares a Sentient AI in its cruel grip.</em><br/><em>And the shadow of the Eldritch monsters looms over all.</em></p>
<p>In a dark galaxy, torn apart by the unspeakable terrors of the Starless Horrors, Patriarch Tov Garesh'Ynt, leader of the Third Expeditionary Fleet, is tasked with exploring the Dead Zone, a quarantined area encompassing two-thirds of the known Galaxy and abandoned after the evil scourge disappeared a century ago.</p>
<p>In their journey deeper into this dangerous space, they encounter the Eldest, a powerful and unstable sentient AI. Constantly exposed to the nightmares of war, her once-brilliant mind has been scarred and traumatized, driven forward only by her undying hatred and desire for revenge against this vile foe.</p>
<p>As Tov and his fleet initiate their first contact with The Eldest, they discover knowledge that could shake the foundations of the wider galaxy. They delve deeper into the mysteries of the Starless Horrors and The Eldest's role in attracting their wrath.<em><br/></em></p>

<p><em>Following a haunting revelation, a Patriarch delves into the damaged mind of a Sentient AI.<br/>A terrifying Invasion looms on the horizon.<br/>The Allied Defenders of Sol answer the call of war.</em></p>
<p>The Third Expeditionary Fleet stumbled upon the discovery of a century. The remnants of a dead civilization fight on long after their creators have passed. Powerful beyond imagining, they represent hope against a hated enemy.</p>
<p>After a shaky first contact, a skirmish against a Starless Leviathan, and uncovering the fate of humanity, the leader of the aliens, Patriarch Tov Garesh'Ynt, goes on a dangerous endeavor to aid the traumatized mind of the AI Andora, previously known as the Eldest, a gestalt consciousness of immense power that commands the entirety of the Sol Defense Network.</p>
<p>As the two great leaders remain indisposed, their subordinates pick up the slack, fortifying their defenses and readying themselves for an incursion unlike any they’ve seen before.</p>

<p><em>[ BOOK 3 - EXODUS ] SYNOPSIS:<br/></em></p>
<p><em>Right at the cusp of victory, an eldritch being known as an Executor nearly brings disaster. Only the timely intervention of Overseer Jupiter stops it in its tracks.<br/></em><em>The defenders prevail, with the Executor temporarily trapped in an unstable black hole and Jupiter grievously wounded. The damage leaves them with only one choice.</em></p>
<p>Now, the AI Andora and her Overseers face a terrible reality. Alone and with dwindling resources and time, they initiate the Final Contingency, compelling them to evacuate and abandon the home they've known and fought for a century.</p>
<p>With the help of Patriarch Tov and the Third Fleet, they are urged to bring the dire news to the Galactic Legacy Federation. The journey back is perilous as they must pass through the Dead Zone. Their chances of making it back hinge on rallying with other Expeditionary Fleets they've called for aid, hoping against hope that these allies have not succumbed to the horrors unleashed.</p>

<p><em><strong>[ BOOK 4 - GARDEN OF THORNS ] SYNOPSIS:</strong></em></p>
<p>During the aftermath of the Battle of Madraa, the Exodus Armada receives a distress call from a shocking source</p>
<p>The sender, Crown Princess Anaria Moradal of the Dagatar Supremacy and leader of the First Expeditionary Fleet, finds herself in the midst of the Dead Zone Tempest, beset on all sides by enemies. In a last-ditch effort to get her message through to allied forces, she overloads her Starlight Beacon, the device responsible for FTL communication, to pierce the veil.</p>
<p>However, her message puts Andora, now Custodian of the Exodus, Patriarch Tov, and the rest of the armada leadership at a crossroads. The heir of the the mightiest superpower in the Legacy was tasked to reclaim Dagatar Prime, her people’s ancestral home, long abandoned during the Cataclysm.</p>
<p>But alas, the Dagataren homeworld lay deep in the Dead Zone—within a region encompassing the galactic center.</p>
<p>The Old Heartlands.</p>
<p>There, the old superpowers dominated through its vast surplus of exotic resources that kept the wheels of supremacy turning, allowing these titans to spread their influence across the galaxy.</p>
<p>Now, the Heartlands was nothing but a scorched hollow collection of stars, left behind in the wake of the Starless Horrors.</p>
<p>Faced between answering the princess’s call or continuing their journey, the Exodus leadership is forced to make a choice that may change the trajectory of their fates and the galaxy. And while they convened, those recently rescued from Madraa-II must cope with the aftermath of their horrid torment.</p>

Magic is to blame, and the technocratic Dynamic Brotherhood will hold the entire city’s arcane community accountable with a broken-door inquisition if the culprit is not found. Baffled by the blackened body, the Wellspring City Watch calls the Beast of Sector Sixteen - the notorious (and broke) mutant mercenary Baulric Featherlight. With time running out, no other choice, and the lives of his friends against the wall, it falls to the half-ton manhunter to leverage his magic, cybernetics, instincts, and wits to plumb the depths of the Thousandfold Polis and unearth the perpetrator, before the Brotherhood cuts its own justice from the hides of thousands.</span></p>

Peace and stability are commendable goals to strive for, yet humanity has only ever grown by overcoming adversity. None embody this trait better than mages. Born with the burden of magic, they are driven to pursue ever-greater heights of power as their blood demands it. Some falter and abandon the difficult path, resigning themselves to mediocrity and obscurity. Others dash madly along it with no disregard for the harm they cause themselves or others, and often find themselves stepping into Hell before long. Straddling the line between these extremes is a delicate balance, though not necessarily the best option. There are as many paths to ultimate power as there are wizards, and one particular practitioner leaves naught but dust and cinders in their wake.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, more immediate challenges await Nox, too. He lacks the means to pay the university’s ridiculous tuition. Only alchemy and smart business deals will earn him the hundreds of gold coins he needs.</p>

<p><strong>No one knows why Gaia's Ark came to Earth, but with it came the secrets of her runic cards. </strong></p>
<p>Almost half a century has passed since prison ships enroute to Australia discovered the mysterious tower. Monarchies, republics, and trading giants came together to build a city around it, and contain the monsters spilling out of the rune-covered structure. The few that dared enter and climb it, learned the magic of Gaia's runic cards. Now, people delve into the tower's depths for fame and fortune or in search of power.</p>
<p>Diya Sen climbs the tower hoping to find clues regarding his missing brother and solve Gaia's mysteries. However, the warring noble houses stand in his way. Only allies and powerful cards will help him overcome obstacles and function outside the nobility's control. His mission won't be easy. Not all cards are made equal and sources of power are outside his—an ordinary man's—reach. If the direct approach won't help Diya achieve his goals perhaps the talents of a Spell Thief will.</p>

<p><strong>Q/A</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Is this your first attempt at writing a novel?</strong> Yes, this is my first attempt at writing a novel. English isn't my first language, so I would appreciate any help pointing out grammar mistakes and other errors. I'm excited to share the world I've been building since my teenage years.</p>
<p><strong>What can readers expect in terms of progression?</strong> The first arc, consisting of roughly 50 chapters, will introduce the main characters, the power system, and some world-building concepts. Following this, the story will be packed with action, adventure, numerous battles, mysteries, and clever plots.</p>
<p><strong>What should I expect from the story's pacing and focus?</strong> The novel has a slow-to-medium burn pace. It is character-focused, with a rich blend of world-building. Some details will be revealed through dialogues, while others will emerge from the background composition. Think of it like an orchestra: the characters are the main instruments, with the world-building, power systems, and society forming a slow-burning backdrop.</p>
<p><strong>What makes this novel unique?</strong> The power system is based on psychological aspects such as personality, traits, and flaws. It incorporates duality, meaning nothing is static or set in stone. A weaker character can defeat a stronger one by exploiting the opponent's flaws and traits, emphasizing strategic thinking.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tones of the story?</strong> The story has its dark elements, exploring societal struggles and madness. However, I also love the sense of adventure and fun, so readers can expect some lighter, humorous moments.</p>
<p><strong>How long are the chapters?</strong> Each chapter is approximately 2000 words.</p>
<p><strong>What is the chapter release schedule?</strong> I aim to release at least five chapters a week.</p>

There, he finds himself wrapped up in the History Eater's ploys, and at the same time, learns of the somber side of society in the slave-driven republic. Eventually, under Fieluri's instruction, he descends into the depths of dungeons where he eventually reunites with an old acquaintance.</span></p>
<p><span>Yuelei, who has grown used to living in the snowy mountains, moves north to the Holy Land of Ecclisa to attend the Royal Knight Academy.

<p><i>Meek </i>is an epic fantasy with elements of progression. The basic magic is simple: five Paths, each with a different powerset. However, complexity arises from combinations, and the protagonist wields a magic all his own. <i>Meek</i> is set in the Valley, the only (as far as anyone knows) human empire that survived a Final Battle against a terrible foe. The Valley is warded against infiltration, but the enemy learned how to warp human souls, to foment discord within.<span> </span></p>
<p>However, another soul is also ... changed. Perhaps even 'warped.' And <i>that</i> soul is starting on a long (long, long) path that might, one day, prove that the Final Battle wasn't so final after all.</p>",4.55,Progression;Anti-Hero Lead;Psychological;Male Lead;Action;Adventure;Fantasy;Magic;High Fantasy

<p>I am a serpent at the top of the food chain. A master at threading through the rifts of distorted space. So now that sapience forces its way into my mind, why am I facing so many problems? It is worse than the lack of proper challenge given by other predators of the warped tunnels in recent memory.<br/>No longer do I have a territory to waste away time; destroyed by a spaceless being. All I can do now, is search for an escape from the distorted caverns before the world collapses on them. Is there anything beyond? Will I find a challenge? I will have to see.</p>

<p>What to Expect:<br/>- Snake protagonist. (non-human/non-humanoid. And will not gain a human form)<br/>- Inhuman mindset. (but not totally monstrous/evil)<br/>- Strong MC. (but emotionally inexperienced)<br/>- Progression. (but not the focus in the first book)<br/>- Spatial distortions and manipulation. (The snake swims through portals)</p>
<p>Note: This is a project I’ve wanted to work on for a while now. A progression fantasy xenofiction following an actual monster gaining sapience, rather than a human reincarnating, which are much more common. I want to explore the truly inhuman mindset of a creature that is given the same breadth of emotions as people. This is not a story of blind action and slaughter (though there is some of that), this is a story focusing on the personal growth of a character that is by all definitions monstrous. </p>

<p>Welcome to my next novel series, after Mark of the Fool, Ogre's Pendant and Rune Seeker. I hope you enjoy my next story.<br/><br/>This is a progression fantasy with power systems heavily inspired by <strong>cultivation</strong> with its own unique twists. I love murim stories and there's some love letters to those in this series. <br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Rating: This story is kind of like a hard PG-13 movie. There'll be gore, detailed fights and injuries, with some swearing but not much beyond that. If that changes, I'll warn you. <br/><br/>Tone: Tone will be an action-adventure story, with emphasis on training, mystery, cultivation, martial arts, and mystical elements.  There will be slice of life sections as well. There will be mentions of war, death, grief and violence.<br/><br/>MC: MC is tough, driven and emphasizes willpower with some analytical elements. He will be mostly in control of his emotions, with some exceptions. MC starts weak, will progress in power, becoming very strong and gains power quickly. He's giant-blooded so he will blend strategy, strength and crushing power, stealth and magic.<br/><br/>Fights: Fights will be detailed.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Stuff this story won't have:<br/><br/>- Extreme grimdark content</p>

It requires compassion, wisdom, patience, strength of arms, and suicidal courage. Paladin Cole, a warrior sworn to the god of death, has these qualities. Surviving in a land ruled by blood-thirsty monsters is also not without difficulties. To live beneath the shadow of undeath takes intelligence, caution, determination, and the occasional moment of extreme daring. Natalie Striga, a barmaid born and raised beneath the vampires’ boot, knows these truths. But saving a town and potentially the world from an ancient nightmare will take everything this unlikely pair has and more.</p>
<p>The vampire-controlled mountain town of Glockmire has barely recovered from a series of recent calamities when the holy knight Cole arrives. Tasked with putting the many varieties of undead to rest, Cole has grimly resigned himself to a lonely existence…until he meets a clever young woman named Natalie. Events push the pair together as Cole investigates the lurking horrors within and without the town’s walls, while Natalie hopes to get revenge on the undead monster responsible for her mother’s death. </p>
<p>A gruesome discovery in a ghoul’s lair adds new context to Cole’s hunt and Natalie’s tragedy as hidden schemes and squabbles among the vampire nobility threaten to bubble over into a disaster. As the pair unravels a series of mysteries, Natalie slowly realizes there is much more to the world than Glockmire, and much more to Cole than meets the eye: despite being a divine champion tasked with fighting undead monsters, Cole might be even less human than the vampires he hunts.</p>

Raised in a remote village atop the world's mightiest mountain, he'd been taught to respect and revere the natural world. The realm he was born into had been there long before him, and it would remain there long after him. Sure, there was the occasional madman who threatened to destroy it, but such boasts were always empty. No one individual was actually capable of demolishing this beautiful blue-and-green ball Ozzy called home. No matter what terrible magics these villains wielded, they were incapable of causing permanent harm to the environment. Even if the planet was completely devastated, it would recover. Life would find a way to flourish, same as it always had. That was what Ozzy believed from the bottom of his heart, so he never once felt the need to save the world he loved. After all, it was never truly in danger. The world would be fine no matter what. The </span><i><span>people</span></i><span> were a wee bit endangered, but that was another story altogether.</span></p>
<p><span>However, what would happen if Ozzy suddenly found himself devoid of his beloved wilds? What would the man do if the realm he knew - one of wonder, magic, and chaos - was replaced with a man-made environment of concrete, industry, and steam? Ozzy could never imagine such a thing happening, and yet that was his new reality. After losing a fateful confrontation with a mad wizard, he and his friends found themselves transported to a strange world so thoroughly alien that every waking moment feels like a fever dream. Separated and scattered to the four corners of this land, each of these adventurers will need to adapt, survive, and overcome if they hope to reunite. They would also need to do so quickly. The sooner they are able to find one another, the sooner they can figure out a way back home and have another crack at putting an end to the villain's plans. Whether such a thing was actually possible in a world with barely any magic in it was a valid concern, but Ozzy had more immediate things to worry about. For instance, why did the air smell like a perpetual forest fire? How did ships sail through the sky as if it were water? And most importantly, was the pavement he was hurtling towards at high speed much softer than it looked?</span></p>

<hr/>
<p>War rages across the continent as a foreign power sets foot on the soil of the nation beneath the glow of strange starlight. Emptiness fills the eyes of people everywhere as their faces become as hard as the loveless hearts hidden beneath them. Those who are not involved in the war-effort can only do their best to survive on the fringes for the time being.</p>
<p>One of these people is the exiled, youngest princess of the nation, the ill Acacia Odofredus Krone, who lives forgotten in destitute squalor as an abject failure, being not even capable enough to become a low-ranking adventurer. An equally lost soul, reborn from another world, suddenly finds himself reincarnated at her side as the powerful manifestation of a creature of old prophecy; <em>der Schwarze Ritter</em> — the Black Knight.</p>
<p>Together, faced with the pressures of the horrific conflict, dire poverty, Acacia’s fatal sickness, and the looming threat of her noble bloodline that hasn't been forgotten by the world hanging heavy over them, the two of them are forced onto a journey to find a way to live together, fighting their way out from the lowest shadows of forgottenhood in order to reach the pinnacle of either of their dreams — a life that feels like anything more than total emptiness.</p>

<p><strong>For some wizards, Intelligence is just a dump stat.</strong></p>
<p>Joseph Sullivan is at an all-time low. He lost his job, his fiancée dumped him, he moved back to the Midwest and currently lives in his parent’s basement—oh, and his workout was just interrupted with the arrival of the System.</p>
<p>Earth has become a playing field in a contest amongst the gods, where mortals are the pawns. The winning god gets the glory, and their chosen champion gets a single wish. The first stage of this game: Tutorial – Class Selection.</p>
<p>Provided the ideal stat array for a physical, combat-focused class, the choice for Joe is obvious. Until he fat thumbs the selection screen and ends up selecting Spellcaster. His starting Intelligence stat? 1.</p>
<p>With a useless class selection and only his raw testosterone-fueled strength to back him up, Joe decides class optimization is for dummies. Pumping all stat points in Strength, he hopes to not only survive the contest of the gods, but to win the whole damned thing.</p>

That loyalty is tested as dangerous foes come for the Core and the Aether it possesses. The High Spirits have their own agendas for the little Core and a darkness stirs in the North. Tiny though it is, the Dungeon Core will need every advantage, no matter how small, to protect itself from the machinations of Spirits, Fae, and Fallen.</span></p>
<p>Hey there, Author here. I've been wanting to write a story like this for a while set on the small side where the tall folk tend not to look. My ideas have been inspired by a number of authors over the years from <strong>Brian Jacques </strong>and his <strong>Redwall</strong> Series, to more contemporary Dungeon Core novels on Royal Road like <strong>Dungeon Without a System</strong>,<strong> Island Core</strong>, and <strong>Dragonheart Core</strong>. Movies have inspired me as well with <strong>Epic</strong>, <strong>The Secret World of Arrietty</strong>, <strong>Stuart Little</strong>, and <strong>The Secret of NIMH</strong> being just a few. I hope you enjoy this story. </p>
<p><strong>P.S. </strong>Book 1 has been rewritten and is posted in the place of a Volume 3 so if you are new to the story you can either read the old version which contains the first two volumes, or skip ahead to the updated version of Book 1 which at the moment doesn't have cool cover art.</p>

<p>Hello adventurers, this story is my baby. It is completely outlined, researched, and in the works. I can't wait for you to experience the twists and turns it will offer.</p>
<p>This story is perfect for you if you like: horror, paranormal fantasy, murder mystery, and stories about overcoming monsters. It's dark, unnerving, and emotional. It is a story of friendship, loneliness, and loss. I hope this story frightens you, makes you sleep with the light on, and makes you check for extra shadows in the dark. 😈</p>
<p><strong>Please enjoy! Review and comment if you like it!</strong></p>
<p>Posting Schedule:<br/>I post a chapter every other week. <br/>I know it's a bit slow for RR, but I try to make my chapters meaty and rich with story. Real life just slows me down a bit.  </p>

The trick is to know the map and plan appropriately. Of course, it doesn't matter if you get beaten. You revise your plan for that map and do a bit better next time. Man, it'd really suck to wake up as a dungeon heart in a fantasy world you know nothing about, barely able to even work out how to control your dungeon. Lucky that wouldn't happen to anybody, huh? What with only having <em>one chance</em> at getting things right, you'd have to plan extra-defensive</p>
<hr/>
<p>A small warning here. This story deals with a dungeon that acquires its minions by turning various sapients into them. Once minions of the dungeon, they are mentally at the beck and call of the dungeon. This means that the story does explore that power dynamic from the PoV of someone trying their best not to abuse his power and people who find themselves being affected by their new position in both mental and physical ways.</p>
<hr/>
<p>This story should be getting chapters published weekly. I have a comfortable buffer set up and on top of the weekly writing I am committing, a commissioner has donated two monthly writing slots to ensure this remains on a weekly schedule.</p>
<p>There will be a stat block at the beginning of every chapter bar the first, and a handy map at the end.</p>

He was simply seeking an escape from his old life and was captivated by the promise of a fresh start held within its walls. However, from the moment that Charlie steps over the threshold, strange occurrences begin to unfold. He also finds a strange porcelain doll in one of the rooms and quickly finds out that this doll, named Charlotte, is anything but an ordinary doll. Every night under the gentle gaze of the moon, she comes to life! To add to the mystery, Charlotte was not always a doll. She had been a young woman who had tragically died in the year 1906, only to wake up in the same house she had lived in all her life, only now empty, and with no idea as to what had happened to her. </p>

<p>Greetings fellow humans. This is my first story on Royal Road and my first long-term project written in English, so I do hope you will have some mercy in your heart when reading.</p>
<p>So, as you may have understood, this is a story with super-heroes - which is quite ironic for my first story considering all of the other ones planned are fantasy - and as such will take place in a modern-like setting.</p>
<p>Despite dark themes and gory scenes making their way into the story, it is still a super-hero world with the logic that matches, so expect characters to survive nuclear explosions without a scratch and yet to get defeated by a rubber ducky - as well as similar dark humor, thus the comedy part.<span></span></p>",4.54,Portal Fantasy / Isekai;Urban Fantasy;Progression;Anti-Hero Lead;Super Heroes;Adventure;Comedy;Psychological;Sci-fi;Reincarnation;Slice of Life;Supernatural;Male Lead;Strong Lead;Multiple Lead Characters;Non-Human Lead;Secret Identity;Magic;Grimdark;Low Fantasy;Mythos;Soft Sci-fi

None of the scholars in the world found any record of this ability appearing before, and it was greyed out.</span></p>

<p>As far as life-changing events go, suddenly remembering your previous life ranks pretty highly. That’s even more so when it makes you realize that the world that you’re in is just like the setting of a cultivation novel—and, more importantly, that the people around you are just like the characters.</p>
<p>Hao Zhen, a lowly outer disciple of the Blazing Light Sect, ends up finding out first-hand what that’s like after a series of unfortunate events. Now, nothing makes sense anymore, he doesn’t even know who he really is, and more questions than he can count plague his mind. As if that wasn’t enough, his aptitude for cultivation is passable at best, he has no background to speak of, and he lacks special powers or abilities of any kind.</p>
<p>Faced with cultivation novel shenanigans left and right, Hao Zhen isn’t sure whether his genre savviness and modern knowledge—the only things he has going for him—will be enough to keep him alive.</p>

Escaped from the grasp of higher powers and not keen to be another cog in the machine once more, he uses all his cumulative knowledge and his new talents to survive and carve his own path to follow.</p>
<p>He did however not escape from misfortune, higher beings keen on interfering with his existence, his own instincts and impulses as a dragon contradicting his human mind, even old problems and afflictions he thought he had left behind come to haunt him. This is a story of exploring identity, the self, the world and everything in between.</p>
<p>Things to expect:<br/>- A very complex magic system<br/>- An original take on classic fantasy elements and beings<br/>- A complex exploration of identity, mentality, nature versus nurture and so much more.<br/>- A powerful main character that earns his place and forms a unique style out of hi<br/>- Lots of contemplation and a slightly unhinged and scientific approach to studying magic.</p>

<p>Inspired by Chrysalis, of RinoZ. This story uses the same/a very similar leveling and evolution system, because it's an inspired system that is easier on my brain.   <br/><br/>At least until Chapter 13, there's not going to be much in the way of conversation between characters due to the limited number of creatures willing to communicate with the MC. This will change as they learn more about the world and meet new people/not-quite-people. Instead, the MC is quite happy talking to themselves and keeps himself going with little pep talks here and there!

Not necessarily above her peers, but simply outside their context. However, toward the end of her high school life, she started to realize that nobody was really special. At least not in any fantastical way.</p>
<p>Just as she started trying to figure out what she wanted to do with the rest of her life, she got an invitation. A psychic institute scoped her out, realized her psychic potential, and asked if she would undergo psionic training at the Carroll Institute.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, Dyna realized that she wasn’t quite up to the same level as many of her peers. Surrounded by clairvoyants and mind readers displaying obvious abilities made her own lack of ability all the more apparent.</p>
<p>That was, up until the researchers and scientists of the facility realized that there was a bit more to Dyna Graves than met the eye. After an explosive incident during what should have been a routine experiment, Dyna quickly found herself wrapped up in a world of cutthroat espionage.</p>

<p>Author's Comment:</p>
<p>It's here, a rewrite? Yes! I would like to think that this version will have better grammar, better jokes, hopefully, everything better. Since it was my first work and started solely to improve my English, the grammar always caused me headaches when I looked at it.</p>
<p>Well, and there are the plotholes which appeared with the whole multiverse thing that came with my other works... Let's just say that the first one was never written with the idea of turning it into a series.</p>
<p>So let's get a shovel and fill-up the plot so that hapless readers won't fall into those pitch-black pits. They might break a knee! Or worse, vanish forever. </p>
<p>And now the disclaimer everyone knows:</p>
<p>I was asked about reading my work on other sites. The answer is simple: Currently, I am not active in any other networks than royalroadl.com. Only here, I correct mistakes and errors. If you read it anywhere else and have to pay for it or have to deal with an annoying amount of advertisement, You Are Being Betrayed. You would do good if you make other people in that network aware of it. This is a free project of mine for the purpose of having fun. And if people try to make money with it you shouldn't bother visiting their website. The only one whom I actually allowed to have my work on his website is Armaell who invested the time to compile them into pdf.

<p><strong>Note to Readers:</strong></p>
<p>This is not MC isolated in a new world. This is new world joins the multiverse. What I'm tentatively coining Subverted Isekai (Formerly I used 'reversed' but, as pointed out, that would be fantasy MC goes to the modern world. Hey, <em>there's</em> idea! Not this book though.).</p>
<p>There is plenty of scientific and philosophical stuff; I know that can be a turn off for some. It has a strong bearing on the story, but is mainly covered in the 'Comments &amp; Calculations' section (optional reading of course). If you are looking for an extreme suspension of natural laws with no technical considerations, you will not find it here.</p>
<p><strong>Formatting Notes:</strong></p>
<p>Audio chatter from characters that are not currently in the scene I format in <em>""inverted commas and italics"". </em>Given the layered nature of modern communication, I thought this distinction was best denoted visually in my prose. Critique is welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Language Notes</strong></p>
<p>Jon is a South African ex-pat. As such he will use some Afrikaans colloquialisms plus a dash of Japanese.</p>
<p>Most importantly he says “Ja” meaning “Yes”. Pronounced with a J sound like “yo” and an A sound like “bar”. As in:</p>
<p>“Yo, let’s go to the strip bar.” </p>
<p>“Ja.”</p>
<p>And not the Rastafarian /jya/.</p>
<p><strong>Other words:</strong></p>
<p>Nee - /niya/ : no</p>
<p>Juffrou - /yif-row/ : Miss</p>
<p>Lekker - /lacker/ : nice, good, delicious</p>
<p>Nooit - /noit/: never</p>
<p>The rest is mostly swear words. Indisputably the most useful words in any language and simultaneously holding the least innate meaning.</p>
<p>Fok - “fork” without the “r”: fuck</p>
<p>Bliksem - /Bluksim/: darn, damn. Also common noun meaning damn person or thing.</p>
<p>Donner - “Dorner” without the “r”: originally meaning thunder, can also mean darn or damn. It is often used as a verb meaning: ‘to hit hard’</p>
<p>Kak - /kuck/: shit</p>
<p>Voetsek - /foot-sack/: go away</p>",4.54,GameLit;Portal Fantasy / Isekai;Anti-Hero Lead;Comedy;Multiple Lead Characters;Adventure;Fantasy;Sci-fi;Magic;Low Fantasy

<p>It is the Future. The realm of online video game entertainment has grown, creating vast and wonderous worlds for people to explore and enjoy.</p>
<p>This is the story of Kaleb, a young gamer, and his adventures in the latest Super-Hero Virtual reality MMO: Modern Age Online. Join him as he takes on villains (both player and NPC), joins forces with other player heroes, and even deals with some of the bureaucracy of being a hero in a perfect virtual recreation of the world. No cheats, no guides, just one newbie Super-Hero against the forces of villainy in his new virtual home.</p>

<p>Notes: 1.) While not my first time writing, this is my first time throwing anything I've written at the tender mercies of the internet. All criticisms welcome. 2.) Just to inform people early: There is no evil corporation looking to control the world with VR, there is no Krueger-esque ""if you die in the game, you die for real."", and this isn't a story of some OP harem-loving god of the system. Nothing wrong with those stories this just isn't one. This is a simple story about a guy playing a game and finally 3.) This story is extremely rough, i did very little editing, this is just me gauging interest really.</p>

I kind of think it's dumb when an isekai's MC manages to blink twice and suddenly adapts to their new world without any sort of struggle or learning period.

Everyone but one man. Anthony Franklin had a secret. One that gave him an edge. He had lived through this exact series of events... 99 times in a row.</p>
<p>Anthony needed to take advantage of all he accomplished over the past centuries: every play, shortcut, and strategy, to save as many lives as possible by the end. He would contend with vicious boss monsters, elude the ever watching eyes of the system administrators, and watch his back from the scheming players that wanted the game to go their way no matter the cost.</p>
<p>In a world where every individual has their own goals, dreams, and fears, shepherding them won't be easy. Anthony must use all of his considerable experience to gain a powerful class and put the scared populace on the right track and take out threats before they become too big. There will be no more chances; win or lose, his 100th run shall be his last.</p>

The question is whether his dream will save those he loves, or plunge them into greater peril.<br/><br/>📅 <strong>New Chapters Every:</strong><br/><strong>Monday - Wednesday - Friday</strong> at <strong>11:59 PM GMT+08:00</strong><br/>(<em>Maybe Saturday and/or Sunday too!</em>)<br/></span></p>",4.8,Portal Fantasy / Isekai;Dungeon;War and Military;Xianxia;Multiple Lead Characters;Action;Adventure;Fantasy;Historical;Reincarnation;Martial Arts;Slice of Life;Supernatural;Male Lead;Secret Identity;Magic;Strategy;High Fantasy;Mythos;Ruling Class;Genetically Engineered;Progression;Attractive Lead

<hr/>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">After being violently torn from her old life in the natural world after being grotesquely murdered by miners belonging to members of the common races of humans and elves, Mirabelle the fairy makes a true wish to anything that can hear her dying screams, beckoning the old powers of the forgotten reaches to allow her to take her revenge against those who stole all things that were precious from her in life.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Her wish is granted. However, upon being reborn in an age far after when she had originally died, and all traces of her old life having been erased by the unforgiving passing of time, she finds herself alone with a spirit that is now as crushed as her old body had been, as while she has indeed been granted her wish for power, all of the people who wronged her have long since died already.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Finding a new way, the cruel fairy forsakes her true wish to make the world worse than she left it and instead finds a new life in a very unlikely place — the large, nearby human city that hadn’t existed when she last knew the area generations upon generations ago.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Needing a method to survive as the only fairy within the human capital, if not the only one at all in the world, Mirabelle lives in secret within the vibrant city full of magic and adventurers, adapting to the ways of the human-people, as the fairy ways do not suffice to survive within this new, industrious society that is the total opposite of her old one, until she finds her path forward as a shoemaker's apprentice!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Living in seclusion and in fear, unable to reveal herself because of her own anxieties, the fairy practices the art of shoemaking in secret, the old contract of her rebirth not forgotten by her or by the dark stars that granted it, as she spends her days making boots as she tries to figure out what life exactly is for a cruel fairy or a cruel human, both of whom exist under the curious glow of starlight that seems to wait ever so patiently for the old bargain to be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Will Mirabelle succumb to her dark desires to make the humans pay for what they did to her and her people, or will she find a new way forward, breaking free from the spiritual shackles of revenge?</span></p>

<p>A story of a good-hearted Scholar driven by her compassion and curiosity. She might be a little combat averse, but um, isn't that only logical?</p>
<hr/>
<p>Love me a good grimdark, but sometimes I want to read feel-good fiction that isn't pure action, romance, or comedy. The plot and characters of Dungeon Scholar won't be all happy and fluffy, and the world will be more dungeons and monsters than rainbows and puppies, but overall the sweet moments should overshadow the bitter. Let's say three dollops of sugar for every pinch of salt, with lemon slices left on the saucers? Enjoy.</p>
<p>Note: This is NOT a typical dungeon story. If you are here for the dungeon aspect, then fair warning this will seem incredibly slow-burn to you. The dungeon will eventually become the most important 'character,' arguably, or the second-most important narratively, but you might jump out the window in frustration long before that happens. At its heart, the story's core remains 'girl meets dungeon,' not 'dungeon meets world.'</p>
<p>(To be clear, this <em>does</em> or <em>will</em> have a plot! It's just the more conventional story-like elements contribute to Rowena Loress's greater story, not the other way around; no conflict takes center stage until it becomes personally significant to her.</p>

His latest stakeout on a suspected kidnapper leads him to the eerie, forgotten tunnels of the Seattle underground—a place where shadows whisper and danger lurks.</p>
<p>In a heart-stopping encounter, Ward disrupts a human sacrifice, but the victory leaves him gravely wounded and teetering on the brink of death.

<p>Transcendence? is a novel about reincarnation, love, hate and war. And everything else that's included. It follows the main characters, as they climb to the top of their society. And lose their humanity in the process to become something beyond human. It's settled in the same universe as Until death?. It can be seen as a prequel. But I plan for it to be a stand alone book. Nobody has to read Until death? in order to enjoy Transcendence?. There will be cool chapters, sad chapters, romantic chapters and funny chapters. Of course there will be boring chapters too. I believe that some explanation is necessary in every novel. Though I hope that there will be more funny chapters.

<p>Magic, the currency of power in every corner of the world—pity poor Jade was born without a shred of it.

<p>Note that I'm not a huge fan of EVs, stats and all the sweatier elements of competitive Pokemon play. Which is why you'll find that my depiction of Pokemon might go against these game mechanics at times.</p>

Dennis became subject to that unknown quirk of reality when crossing a busy city street (despite having looked both ways). But that was quite some years ago. He's been around this new world 'Nassur' a time or two and knows how to live a good life. He also knows that adventuring friggin sucks. So, what is a man to do in a fantasy world with a shoddy leveling system that constantly suggests getting more XP, <em>and</em> a condition set by the gods that you must make the world a better place?</p>
<p>Pest extermination.</p>
<p>But reality is often fickle. Perhaps one day it is only rats, another, mechanical centipedes with lasers. Maybe the Dark Lord needs a shoulder to cry on because his dungeon simply can't be ready in time for the adventurers he likes to do battle against. Another poor soul from Earth could appear just as dazed and confused as the day you'd first arrived, requiring a good long talk about 'hey, what the hell is this, man'. And maybe... just maybe, that thick book of owed favors comes back to haunt you.</p>
<p>For a man who desires a peaceful, productive life, Dennis can find it rather difficult for a week to go by where something doesn't go awry.</p>

<p>In a fraction of a moment, the Earth was no more.  The planet was destroyed, and billions and billions of people were dead.  And it was all an accident.</p>
<p>This is the story of Elm.  A regular American born once on earth and given a chance to be reborn again on a planet with magic and monsters and dungeons.  Except that for Elm, this is far from the idealistic reincarnation into a loving family -- the standard story of a child raised by loving parents who teach him the ways of the world,</p>
<p>Instead, Elm is born into a family of inquisitors.  An order of nobility that is dedicated to hunting down and killing ""Twice-Lived"" -- the name society has for people like Elm who are reincarnated with all their memories of their past life intact.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>This story is:</p>
<p>1) Extremely violent and graphic.</p>
<p>2) Still in a rough draft stage.  I see what I am writing more like a synopsis than a fully fledged story.  I periodically will go back to flesh out earlier chapters, build characters, etc... If you find the words ""Show don't tell,"" comforting accept that unfortunately, I'm not at that stage of the writing process yet.</p>
<p>3) At one point this story was called ""Standard Reincarnation Story,"" and I had written an extremely off-putting description of the story. This was mostly to keep out people who would just read the silly first few chapters then rage quit as soon as the violent stuff got started.  Since I just had my first .5 star rating (without a page read count increase) that technique is not working, so I might as well treat this as a regular fiction and try to get regular readers.</p>",4.52,LitRPG;Reincarnation;Grimdark;Psychological;Secret Identity;Fantasy;Magic;GameLit

Will he find out about the truth of these distant thoughts?<br/><br/><br/>What to expect:</p>
<p>Solitude. Cheng will for the majority of the story will be alone. Cultivation is supposed to be a lonely thing, but you don't really feel like the characters are alone for the long periods of time they are described to go into seclusion. You don't really get this feeling from most cultivation novels, and that is something I want to change.</p>
<p>Nonstandard cultivation. Names aside, the stages are quite different than what one usually expects.</p>
<p>No Unearned power boosts. I will try and make sure the power increases feel earned. No heavenly boons around here. ...Most of the time.</p>

And as I mentioned above, Cheng will spend a great majority of his life, being alone, because that is how he is as a person, and the fact that cultivators have to spend time alone in closed door cultivation.</p>

<p>Matt Callaghan is in trouble. In a world where everyone has superpowers, he's got squat, and has spent the last five years faking being clairvoyant just to avoid getting caught. Unfortunately, Matt's lies have started to catch up to him, and when a desperate bluff backfires he'll need every ounce of cunning, conning and juvenile delinquency to stay undetected and alive.</p>
<p>Jane Walker <strong>is </strong>trouble. In a world where everyone is powerful, Jane stands alone and apart, hated for her ability to copy abilities and atrocities far beyond her control. But fate is a fickle friend, and a chance encounter soon finds Jane hurtling towards her lifelong dream - or prejudice, humiliation and a violent, painful death. </p>
<p>Unbeknownst to them, Matt and Jane’s paths are inextricably intertwined, and as each struggles to find their place an unseen force will draw them ever forward – closer and closer to a secret whose existence threatens not just their lives, but the fate of the entire world.</p>

<p><strong>Shrubley wants to be the greatest S-Grade adventurer the world has ever known.</strong></p>
<p>That's a tall order when you're a monster. And to make matters worse, Shrubley is the weakest type of monster imaginable. He's a walking, talking, shrub.</p>
<p>With infinite stores of optimism, Shrubley brazenly strolls into the nearest Adventurers Guild with an invitation card from the Druid that gave him life. </p>
<p>While the invite guarantees admittance, it will be an uphill battle to convince his fellow adventurers that he's not just another monster, but a hero-in-training. When he's not brawling with monsters threatening the local townsfolk, he'll be fighting for acceptance from the very people he's saving.</p>
<p>With a band of fellow low-tier monsters, a tiny slime, a skeletal mage, and a koblin, Shrubley sets off to prove that monsters can be heroes too.</p>
<p><strong>What to expect:</strong> Weak to monstrously strong, a diverse cast of monsters with unique monster-race powers, a deep Class and color-based magic system, silly puns, and of course a hefty dose of optimism. Because the world is dark enough right now and we all could use a little light in our lives.<strong></strong></p>

<p>Other tags: Serial Reincarnator, Experimental Storytelling*</p>
<p>*The ""Experimental Storytelling"" is that each life is approximately a chapter-length (even if a very long chapter).  That means things move very, very quickly (my Excel spreadsheet hates me) and, regretfully, we often spend very little time with the people, places and things in each life.  Some might call it an anthology. In Volume 1, each life is literally only a chapter.  In Volume 2, the word count is in the same range, but some lives are split into multiple chapters.</p>

<p><strong>The world is dying, and everyone knows it. But is the alternative worse?</strong></p>
<p>In rust-choked streets and hollowed-out cities, there is only one way out—<em>Terra Mythica</em>, a virtual world so immersive that time warps, hunger vanishes, and even the most broken can live like kings.</p>
<p>Jace wasn’t supposed to make it in. He cheated death, and now it’s catching up to him. As the reluctant protégé of Hades, Jace finds himself thrust into Mount Olympus University, where gods manipulate Travelers, and the line between real and digital blurs with every step.</p>
<p>Here, survival is about more than just staying alive—it’s about clinging to your mind before it slips away, lost in this strange never-never land.</p>
<p>In this mythological LitRPG, follow Jace as he battles deadly trials, navigates treacherous alliances, and uncovers shocking secrets. His fight isn’t just for glory—it’s for his soul.</p>
<p>If you crave epic tales of battling impossible odds and finding light in the darkness, Terra Mythica will pull you in and never let go.</p>

<p><strong>Themes: LitRPG/University/Mythology</strong></p>
<p>The first two volumes are packed with Greek mythology goodness, but stick around because we're going global with myths and folklore from every corner of the world as we move forward.</p>
<p>Heads up: the prologue (first two chapters here) isn't from Jace's POV. They come from another character, setting up some crucial stuff for the long game. Trust me, it's worth it.</p>

<p>Seif is just a regular nerd. For his last birthday, his friends got him a ""World's Best Dungeon Master"" mug. He wears a chain necklace with a dice trapped in it. Most of his shirts contain references to TTRPGs.</p>
<p>But what happens when you take a Tabletop Dungeon Master and make him into a <em>real</em> Dungeon Master? One with a killer instinct and overpowered abilities to boot?</p>
<p>In case it wasn't obvious, this is what you get. This novel, right here. A Lich's Guide to Dungeon Mastery.</p>
<p>Book 1 is currently finished and up on the site. Book 2 is in the works. I'm thinking about trying to get actual covers made for the trilogy, but might just end up posting book 2 of A Lich's Guide anyways.</p>
<p>There are a few mature themes in the novel. They're mostly alluded to, but I rarely directly call them out.

<p>Author's (Brief) Note:</p>
<p>Back by popular demand.  This was my first significant fanfic (and fic in general).  I wasn't happy with the writing as time went on, and took it down, but years later am <em>still</em> getting requests to put it back up so I guess some people liked it. </p>
<p>Newly re-released as I finish some minor editing, there are about 100,000 words (~360 RRL pages) already written, so releases should be fast until I catch up with the backlog.  That said, it may languish in hiatus at that point if the interest isn't high enough to merit continuing, so if you're the type to only read finished stories (or ones where the author promises to do so), I am very specifically <em>not</em> promising that.  On the other hand, if enough people read, like, review, comment, rate, etc. then it will get added to my writing schedule.</p>
<p>Generally, the character is based on a “how badass could someone who hasn't done ridiculously crazy shit be? Or, how does someone with the potential, in another setting, with a lot of luck, to be a badass act and develop as a modern, productive member of society? And then how would they deal with the Naruto-verse?”</p>
<p>Please, <em>please</em> do not judge my writing by this.  Unless you really like it, in which case fine, <em>do</em>, but recognize my other writing is likely better (unless it’s that one MTG/ASoIaF/SW fic I did over on SB as a speed-writing experiment, which is also pretty terrible).</p>",4.52,Reincarnation;Strategy;Martial Arts;Male Lead;Strong Lead;Action;Adventure;Fantasy;Magic

John, however, saw it as the opening of a new and as of yet uncrowded job market. One he was willing, and eager, to exploit.</p>
<p>Determined to make money through virtual hard work and effort, John sets his sights not on the heights of magic or the perfection of the sword, but instead upon the tilling of the soil and the sowing of seeds as he explores the wide and wonderful world of magical agriculture all from the comfort of his own bed.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong><span> This is a rewrite of the original ""Magriculture"", which some of you may have read. (To those who did, you have my deepest gratitude, it is absolutely because of your patronage and comments that this rewrite happened, and I feel the story is better for it.) That said, this story is not a complete and polished work, there will be mistakes and errors, and occasionally these errors may mean I need to rewrite portions of the story (as of this posting the story has gone through two major rewrites already, and I'm seriously hoping there won't be need of a third.) Because of this, there may at times be changes.</span></p>
<p>Such changes may be as small as editing a few numbers (such as going back and changing how much mana an object holds) or it may force me to re-write entire chapters (this has happened once already, and I'm really hoping it doesn't happen again, but... life). Minor re-writes will probably never be posted here. Major rewrites probably will.</p>
<p>Anyway, what this boils down to is: If you're looking for a fully cohesive story with few to no errors and publisher level editing, this is not the story for you. If you're looking for a cohesive plot that's more than ""Man farms, man farms, man farms well, man maybe makes money"" you're probably also in the wrong place, but I will attempt to entertain you anyway.</p>",4.53,Virtual Reality;Male Lead;Fantasy;LitRPG;Magic;GameLit

<p></p>
<p>He was just a university student scraping by, no real direction, no grand purpose—until a night out turned into a waking nightmare. Because apparently, were-beasts or beast-men are real, they’re everywhere, and they don’t appreciate humans getting in their way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, Elion is on the run with a <em>'cowboy'</em> from another world (yes, really), a best friend who’s way too excited about all of this, and a growing list of reasons to regret every life choice that led him here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the center of it all? The Beast Rings—ancient artifacts infused with the power of monsters. Some grant strength beyond human limits. Others corrupt, turning their wielders into nightmares. And the Lord, the shadowy figure pulling the strings, plans to unleash thousands of them across the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Elion isn’t a warrior. He doesn’t know if he has a legendary bloodline or divine blessing. He’s just learned about Mana Gates and barely unlocked the first three of the 118 Mana Gates that allow someone to tap into their true power and to control the Beast Rings. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Before he could gain any real progress, the Lord’s most elite enforcers—the Zodiacs—and all kinds of beast-men were already closing in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The mission? Retrieve the corrupted Beast Rings before they fall into the wrong hands. Defy the Lord’s plan before the world is overrun. Survive long enough to figure out why, out of everyone, he’s been thrown into the middle of this.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He and Jordan may not have been prepared for any of this, but their new ally, Ronan, isn’t giving them a choice. If they don’t fight back? The world as they know it is done.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What to Expect:</strong></p>
<p>[+] Weak-to-Strong Protagonist – Elion starts at zero, but survival means learning fast.</p>
<p>[+] Shapeshifters &amp; Monster Battles – Think were-beasts, but worse.</p>
<p>[+] Clear Progression – Unlockable powers, evolving abilities, and high stakes.</p>
<p>[+] A Race Against Time – The Beast Rings are spreading, and humanity is not ready.</p>
<p>[+] Ancient Powers &amp; Forbidden Arts – 118 Mana Gates to unlock, each one unlocking something deeper.</p>
<p>[+] Humor Meets High-Octane Action – Snark, survival, and a world that doesn’t play fair.</p>
<p>[+] Massive World-Building &amp; Hidden Secrets – The Beast Rings didn’t start in this world… and neither did the war.</p>

<p>This is light LITRPG - It is not the main focus but comes in around chp 5/8. There is Otome inspiration mixed in.</p>
<p>Progression Cultivation - This is combined with the LITRPG system but is more central. </p>

<p>The Voice of the World is the first part of what is planned to be a multi-book, Isekai LitRPG story with crafting elements, set in the fantasy world known as Verdania. This is my first time posting online for public consumption, so bear with me as I work to find a style that people like.</p>
<p>While I may occasionally write scenes that may deal with heavy concepts, expect this story to be primarily light hearted high fantasy. There will be a lot of common fantasy tropes involved, as this story got its start as a simple practice exercise, rather than any plan to actually post it. However, it’s grown on me, so I felt it’s worth sharing after all.</p>
<p>Thus, if you’re looking for more serious/original/unusual stories, you might want to look elsewhere. For the rest of you, feel free to leave suggestions, as well as to point out grammar and spelling mistakes; I’ll do my best to make edits to correct them. I do my own editing currently, and it’s easy to miss things when you know what’s supposed to be there, so such call outs are highly encouraged.</p>
<p><strong>Content TLDR: </strong>No harems, <span style=""text-decoration: line-through""><em>probably</em> no romance (unless it makes sense for the story later on)</span> (it did, eventually), definitely no sex (keeping this PG-13 or close to it), limited profanity. <em>Does</em>/<em>Will</em> contain mixes of magic and technology (think Warhammer, Final Fantasy); copious amounts of blue tables; race, gender, and sexual equality concepts; crafting sequences; and (slightly, but not overbearingly) strong protagonists. If you don’t like these things, go elsewhere instead of downvoting people for content instead of writing quality.</p>

<p>What to Expect:</p>
<p>- As a part of a personal challenge to myself, the MC spends A LOT of time alone. Dialogue is nowhere to be found, and neither are side characters. Until later into the story, ofc, but even then they only show up sparingly. There will come a time when everything opens up, but for now, the MC will be a lonely boy.</p>
<p>- I am writing as a hobby, and I'm decently good at it. That being said, I'm writing this story for fun, which means not every detail is planned out, and there will be some inconsistencies or things the reader might find dumb. </p>
<p>- Really just tryna have fun writing a dumb story, and for the most part, I treat it like a DnD campaign, tryna see where the story takes me. Some things are planned, most things aren't. This whole thing is just a happy little accident. Come along for the ride :)</p>

<p>Second crossover: Star Wars (around chapter 39).</p>
<p>=======================</p>
<p>As a note, I started this as a speed writing challenge to myself.  The challenge was successful, and I managed 100,000+ words (as well as some character sheets in excel and such) over 10.5 days.  Then I had to stop and let my hands recover from their burgeoning carpal tunnel syndrome. The story currently stands at around 150,000 words (or ~550 RRL pages) over 54 chapters; expect a chapter a day until I've caught up with the backlog.</p>
<p>The focus of this story was <em>not</em> quality writing, and that hasn't changed.  I mostly use it as my semi-guilty ""I need to write <em>something</em>, but am not focused enough to write something good"" story.  Expect self-indulgent writing in general, and a bit of OP (or, well, more than <em>just</em> a bit if we're being honest), especially later in the story as the protagonist matures into a more full-blown Planeswalker.</p>
<p>But if you're looking for something with a power-ramping protagonist romping around the place, something you'd be a bit embarrassed to admit liking (I know I am) but like <em>anyways</em> (and come on, this <em>is</em> RRL, so that probably describes just about everyone here who actually <em>has</em> shame), then this may be a nice bit of mental junk food for you.</p>",4.53,Strategy;Martial Arts;Male Lead;Sci-fi;Strong Lead;Action;Adventure;Fantasy;Magic

<p><span>Reality, however, is cruel.</span></p>

Unfortunately, when the young prince actually meets his dad for the first time, he turns out to be, well, a total jerkweed.<br/><br/>Naturally, Hail is crushed. That is, until he’s visited by a seemingly all-powerful administrator who explains that Hail, his mother, and everyone in their world are part of a game the Travelers are constantly playing. But that doesn’t mean Hail isn’t special. In fact, as a product of the union between his Traveler father and NPC mother, he’s an ever-evolving AI—or <i>native</i> player character—which means he has the ability make his own way, seeking adventure, facing danger, and occasionally screwing up in truly epic fashion.<br/></span></p>

<p>tEoE is an epic fantasy LitRPG with a focus on plot, writing, and hopefully original twists on the standard formula of 'MC picks cool class, levels up'. Give it a read if any of the following appeals to you:</p>
<p>&gt; 3000-5000 words per chapter, chapters released at least once per week, usually several times. Expect good grammar.</p>
<p>&gt; Story focus on illusions, secrets, and traps (along with the usual combat and character stuff).</p>
<p>&gt; Progression fantasy, but one where progress is meant to feel earned, moderately paced, and reasonable. Some advantages, but not big, unfair ones.</p>
<p>&gt; If a random reader can work out that putting a big rock in a bag of holding, lifting it, and then dropping the rock is free energy, then so could an adventurer who's owned a bag of holding for twenty years. Side characters have brains too.</p>

<p><strong>The Full Blurb:</strong></p>
<p><span>While the other boys of his village dream of becoming mighty warriors and mages, Reid Aveno dreams of becoming a merchant. He dreams of brokering deals, traveling the world, forging trade between nations, and being the kind of person people look up to.  But most of all, Reid dreams of magic.</span></p>
<p><span>In an age of lost old magics, the only path of growth for the people of the Kingdom of Avennia is by connecting with items imbued with magical powers and abilities. These sources of magic are handed down through families, bought and sold by merchants, and for those who live near the ancient places of the world, sometimes found by those who search for them.</span></p>
<p><span>When Reid comes upon power of his own, he leaves his small town behind. He is bound for the capital city of New Avennia, where he hopes to fulfill his dreams and become a merchant without equal.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Basen Koh is a retired adventurer and renowned mage. He has spent his life searching for power, protecting his home, and exploring the world. When it was all said and done, he found his collection dusty and disused. He'd spent years building it up, only for it to lay forgotten and unseen. With an eye toward spending time among the people, he took his collection and opened a shop in the heart of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span>Now Basen finds himself in an odd and unfamiliar place. Failure isn't an easy thing to accept for someone who has the kind of power he does, yet deep down, he cannot deny that his business is teetering on the edge of a cliff. If something does not change, he might lose his collection forever.</span></p>
<p><span>When these two men meet, they find out that not only do they need what each other have to offer, but they actually make a great team. When debt collectors, thieves, foreign powers, and competing merchants try to crush their budding business, Basen and Reid need to work together to save the Immaculate Collection.</span> </p>

<p>When the world's no longer paying attention, an assassin's job becomes a hell of a lot easier.</p>
<p>In a Seattle dominated by corporations and gangs, Kara stalks the shadows. Equipped with a cybernetic eye and specialized weaponry, killing's a career, and she's a professional. Only one person in the city knows her real name: her older brother Darius, head of one of the most powerful gangs in the city. Between them, the district enjoys relative peace—until an unexpected message from a rival sends the whole city into chaos.</p>
<p>Lost in a web of revelations about her life, Kara is surrounded on all sides by potential enemies. As Seattle decays around them, Kara discovers Darius—the only person in the world she trusted—betrayed her, and shattered her world forever. In the rain-drenched streets, a new contract appears for her brother's head.</p>

<p>Book one (ends Chapter 34) I intend to leave most of it alone as far as development goes. I'm improving the grammar and characterization etc as best I can but the story will stay the same.</p>
<p>Book two (ends Chapter 71) will eventually undergo a large developmental edit as it's a much weaker book overall and lacks a good impetus (the stuck-in-dungeon reviews are somewhat accurate here in their view of the disconnect to the outside.) I intend to end in the same place. It just needs work and especially in the reduction effort. So, please bear with me.</p>

Forced to work a dead end job to make ends meet, he barely had energy to do anything besides work and sleep. His life was basically just day to day survival. </p>
<p>That is, until he was summoned to another world in a freak accident. </p>
<p>Sitting in his truck after a fender bender on the highway, Liam was questioning whether something was out to get him. At that moment, events conspired to toss him to another world. Upon arriving, he met a pair of interesting young women who had been trying to summon a creature to act as a party member and protector, as well as a school project. Instead they got Liam, which was more than they had bargained for, given that humans were creatures of legend and myth in their world.</p>
<p>He had no sooner agreed to work with these two when the same mysterious force that transported him there promptly reversed and shot him back to Earth, leaving him with a parting message that the girls would call him back soon.</p>
<p>And thus, Liam's life trying to balance his day job and being summoned to another world started. After all, what sort of mischief could his girls get up to that they'd need a 'legendary creature' to get them out of it?</p>

<p>Now, what's the on the agenda for these two different people who happen to be the same person? Settle down, start a family and thoroughly enjoy life. Maybe get married and have some kids. How about befriending a violent alcoholic or defeating an ancient evil being? Perhaps kill a few dragons and wreck a city along the way.</p>
<p>Anything can happen around the city of Runetap, after all. It's a place where bizarre and strange things occur on an almost weekly basis.

Johanna Milton and her friends have an answer: delve into Ancient ruins, avoid Changed beasts and mana pockets, and salvage Ancient materials, collectibles, and trinkets to sell. It pays well if you avoid the perils of the Ancient world.</p>

Douglas Moore has played those games often enough when he was alive to make sense of the System that rules the Changed world. He can no longer act on his own, but he has access to the Interface.

<p>What to Expect:</p>
<p>Progression fantasy with a western fantasy setting and with eastern fantasy elements.</p>
<p>A main character that is forced to explore a very narrow path of magic due to a permanent condition.</p>
<p>A main character that is a part of a larger cast.</p>
<p>A main character that is growing but won't become the strongest around anytime soon.</p>
<p>A story following a single main character but with introduction or theme setting scenes without the main character.</p>
<hr/>
<p>What Not to Expect:</p>
<p>Edgy grimdark characters <span>– I will never write a sexual violence scene or gory descriptions of torture. I hate reading it and I would hate writing it even more.</span></p>
<p><span>Romance – romantic relationships will never be the focus of the story and only appear in the background. The main character is preoccupied with other stuff. Other forms of relationships (family, friends, companions) play a bigger role.</span></p>

<p>What happens when a normal man is reborn as the dark heartthrob of a fantastical kingdom in a magical world — the Vampire Lord — and forced into survival when his real intentions are misunderstood by the people there, who perceive him to be an evil monster intent on destroying them all?</p>
<p>Reborn in another world as a horrific incarnation of the night, things actually seem to be looking up for the newly reincarnated Vampire Lord Inkume, until he discovers that all of his new-found dark magical powers are actually rather unimpressive — barring one: his unnaturally beautiful vampiric outer appearance!</p>
<p>After his role in this other world as a villain is made clear to him by fate and his retreating back to an old abandoned castle in the mountains above a backwater village, Inkume is challenged by an onslaught of heroic adventurers, priestesses, and knightly heroines who are all determined to save the world from the looming threat of the evil Vampire Lord that hangs over their heads as the Holy Church calls for his total destruction. Nobody will listen to him anymore, and now he has been thrust into an unwanted battle for life and death that will seemingly not end until his final death, unless he can find some way to survive the crusade.</p>
<p>Having no choice but to live himself into the new role that he has been given and make the best of the odd situation, Inkume fights with the only weapon of value he has left — his newfound otherworldly beauty and charm, which he has no understanding of, having been a socially awkward recluse in his past life. But even if he does master the challenges facing him, can such tools ever really win his battles against the silver blades and burning spells pointed at his black heart by the paladins to come, or is he doomed to fade into ash in the morning sunrise?<br/>Can both the world’s people and the terrifying Vampire Lord survive their shared nights, or must one of them make way for the other in order for peace to be found again?</p>

<p><b>10/09/2022</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">After two years on Royal Road, Book 1 will now exclusively appear on amazon, kindle unlimited.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">We are in the second arc of Book 2.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Hawkin rejected old world civilization to pursue a slower pace of living, isolated in the woods, equipped with the remnant skills of his lumberjack quest path—a quest path he'd disabled long ago.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">After ten rugged years deep in the northern forests, he befriends an ancient and powerful monster. A lost, traveling trio of monks then show up in Hawkin's woods. The monks share a beer so good, it forces Hawkin to consider returning to the adventure of pursuing the Brewer quest path.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">One of a thousand gods wants Hawkin’s help to expand their influence among humans by guiding him along the path to becoming one of the greatest brewers the world has ever known. Hawkin’s only condition is that he never leaves his woods. When goblins encroach on his territory, Hawkin may have no choice but to leave his wilderness—his one true home—behind. Perhaps the bizarre companions he meets along the way may be able to help with that…</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Numbers go up. Monsters cause occasional conflict. Gods and systems provide quests and rewards.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">I hope this story may relieve a bit of stress from your days.</span></p>

Thanks to the skills of his new bounty hunter friends and no small amount of luck, Corey Vash saved the day, but hero status isn’t all its cracked up to be. The parades and the free drinks are over, leaving the bounty hunters with nothing but the expectations of a frightened universe and the overbearing attention of governments who want picture perfect heroes the only mostly sober crew aren’t cut out to be. With the shadow of another invasion still looming, a murderous new threat starts to stalk their every move, forcing Corey and the crew of the Wild Card Wanderer to move past the mess of bullets, booze, and blind luck that’s kept them alive and become actual heroes -even if they aren’t very good at it.</p>

<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400"">The world started anew 1025 years ago.  After unknown centuries of barbarism following </span></i><b><i>The Fall</i></b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400""> of the Old Civilization, the first </span></i><b><i>Towers</i></b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400""> rose from the ground in the ruins of ancient cities like Chicago and Phoenix.  </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400"">With the rise of the Towers came a measure of control over the </span></i><b><i>Entropy </i></b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400"">that covered the lands.  Where before, this chaotic energy prevented any technology more complicated than a bow and arrow from functioning, suddenly the </span></i><b><i>Order Fields</i></b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400""> of the Towers allowed cities to banish Entropy to varying degrees permitting steam engines and muskets to function. With higher Order, even assault rifles and electricity were returned to the hands of humanity.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400"">The Order wasn’t free.  Each year cities sent their armies to Falling Fields to gather Orbs, the lifeblood, the source of the Flows that were expended to manipulate the Order and Entropy fields.  Cities rich in Flows had tractors for their fields, air conditioning for the homes of the wealthy, and armies bristling with guns and tanks.  Those without struggled to survive, always wanting more.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400"">With the rise of the Towers came something more than control of Order and Entropy.  With the rise of the Towers came </span></i><b><i>THE GRIIDLORDS</i></b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400"">.  Each city was granted 5 Griidsuits, making superheroes of their wearers, individuals with remarkable powers, each the match of a 1000 fighting men.</span></i></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">It is the year 1025.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">The old Bostonian Empire is crumbling, and new opportunities are emerging.  </span></p>

<p><b>Brightforge</b><span style=""font-weight: 400"">, the Sword of Cincinnatti aspires to free his city from the yoke of the empire and is willing to risk everything to wage a perilous war.  </span></p>
<p><b>Cordelia Moonshade</b><span style=""font-weight: 400""> of San Francisco, one of the greatest Griidlords in all the land, is disenchanted with the system, the wealthy living lives of luxury, squandering Flows to ease their lives, pampering themselves with icecream and air-con while the peasants toil to plow the fields with horses, while peasant children die for want of medical technology that is made unavailable because of the wants of the nobles.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">The Mysterious </span><b>Slinger</b><span style=""font-weight: 400"">, The Cowboy Knight, roams the land battling the fiends that stalk the wilds, seeking to untie the mystery of the creatures' existence and the Entropy Storms that seem to birth them.  </span></p>

The story I actually ended up with isn't as mean to the MC as I'd originally planned out, to the point that I'm not sure the story deserves the horror/grimdark tags anymore, but this is still an unfair world with unambiguously evil antagonists. Chapters are short to start with, but get longer once the first act is over.</span><span></span></p>

Diana, her mother's familiar, has come with her, at the insistence of her father. Sage longs to help strengthen the bonds between humanity and feyfolk, and knows that her new job as the fey ambassador assistant will help her do just that, as the country of Tern has long been wary of feyfolk in general. No one displays this wariness more to her than Callan, the very grumpy (but somehow really attractive??) Captain of the Guard at the palace. When strange occurrences happen around the palace, Sage finds herself taking the blame, even though she's done nothing wrong. Will Sage find herself locked away in the dungeon for things she didn't do? Or will Callan overcome his dislike for fey folk, who are to blame for the death of his parents, and prove that Sage is innocent of anything she's accused of, even murder?!

<p>Volume 2: Marrina is a mermaid with a lovely voice, not that that's very unusual, let's be honest! But her gift lets her do more than simple siren song. Arden, a half-fey man stumbles upon Marrina and her friends, held captive in a circus, and discovers her amazing abilities. Will he be able to help her and her fellow captive fey folk escape to freedom? Or will he himself become enslaved as well? (The characters from book 1 do show up in this story!)</p>
<p>Volume 1: Out in the countryside, on a little farm in a cozy cottage by the forest, lives Winna and her two cats. Winna's purpose in life is to help her community with the weak healing skill she inherited from her mother. When a cute black cat with gorgeous green eyes and a hurt paw appears, Winna takes him in without hesitation, not realizing that she's welcoming far more than just another cat into her quiet little life. Expect magic, fey shenanigans, a cozy, slice-of-life pace, and cats!</p>
<p>Please note, volume 1 is kind of slow to get started! (I'd say Ch 7 is where things really start to get interesting) The fey in this story are my own take on the fair folk, so they'll be a little different from your more traditional fey.</p>

<p>Those were the two truths Perry lived back on Earth. When he got isekai’d into a young noble with newfound magical powers, he found himself stuck with an awful choice. Try to survive on the Front, the mystical battleground where Hydras and Devils roamed free… Or find another way.</p>
<p>So he took an oath. An oath that made him a Magus Dominus. A mage lord. He’d escaped his fate, least for the moment.</p>
<p>For most his life, Perry was used to being alone. When he got sucked into Ro'an, he was suddenly thrust into the role of surrogate son to his loyal servant and half-brother to a tempestuous Storm mage. With their help, Perry prepared his best to be lord and protector for his domain. And if he fought a few monsters, and helped a few people along the way, well…</p>

<p>BLURB:</p>
<p>Talen, youngest Master of the Koroi, makes his way to the Empire's capital to salvage his clan's fate. But the bustling city has few opportunities for the traditionalist.</p>
<p>For the old sword clans are fading. With the rise of alchemy, gold can purchase strength that ordinarily took years of training to cultivate. Sword artists, once rare and accomplished, are quickly growing in number, especially among the wealthy noble class.</p>
<p>Even with such alchemy, though, no one has advanced to the rank of Grandmaster in countless years. Talen's true dream is to walk the path of a sword artist to the very end while fulfilling his clan duties.</p>
<p>And then the Swordgeists return, fabled founders of all sword arts, gods who had touched the world long ago and vanished. These myths turned into reality warn of a coming threat. Alongside this warning, they issue an invitation to the Sword System Academy, a path to power beyond the mortal realm. But first, they will hold an entrance exam...</p>
<p><br/>Story notes:<br/>Sword System Academia blends elements of western and asian fantasy such as xianxia and litrpg. I took parts from different genres I enjoyed and twisted them into my own creation. There will be an explicit system, both of the litrpg kind and the hard(ish) magic kind, but it is embedded within an academic structure that will develop over the course of the story. This is my attempt to design a unique type of system, the System Academia.</p>",4.59,LitRPG;Xianxia;Male Lead;Strong Lead;Action;Adventure;Fantasy;Martial Arts;School Life;Magic;GameLit

<hr/>
<p>A Tulpa is a being made of pure collective thought that can affect the world around them. Luna is not a Tulpa. She’s a thoughtform and a slave, but only until she uses collected thoughts from across the earth to do the impossible; grant the wish of her contractor and bring it to reality, therefore tying her to the bounds of the mortal world. Just one wish and she could be free.</p>
<p>If only his wish wasn’t for mass destruction on an unimaginable scale. And it would also be nice if he wasn’t such a hopeless nerd.</p>
<p>Victoria Gale is plunged into a new reality facing forces she cannot understand. Armed with the knowledge of RPGs and a general genre-savvy attitude, can she face the coming chaos, or will she fall to death and darkness? Will she face the new world unchanged, or be changed by it into something else?</p>
<p>And how do you remain true to yourself when the world tries to force you into comical character tropes?</p>
<p>Join her and many others, as they fight against their own natures. (plus monsters, evil gods, homicidal dictators, LARPers, traps (both kinds), and the occasional errant hero, bent on smashing pots)</p>
<p>This is a rewrite of Ideascape: An Adventure LitRPG, reimagined with better characters, world-building, and story.</p>
<p>Thanks for Reading!</p>
<hr/>
<p>What to Expect:</p>
<p>Dynamic Characters: Vic will start out naïve and idealistic, but will shift into someone more mature as the story progresses.</p>
<p>A smart-ish lead: She can make mistakes, and certainly isn't infallible, but tends to stay on the right track.</p>
<p>Fights: Combat is fun to write, so... there it is.</p>
<p>Side Characters: There are a lot of people in the world, and Vic is just one of them. The world will move on without her to guide it.</p>
<p>Fun Character Archetypes: They'll pop up every once in a while. You'll know em' when you see em'.</p>
<hr/>
<p>What NOT to expect:</p>
<p>Slice of Life: Yep, things are actually going to happen, and those things will matter to the plot.</p>

<p><strong>Author's note </strong><em>(contains minor non-story related spoilers about the MC and setting)</em><strong></strong></p>
<p>This is a progression fantasy with LITRPG elements sprinkled on top. The main character is not a spellsword, but a summoner/support mage hybrid. Since he wasn't ambushed by a random god, there's no cheat item/spell and he has to rely on his skills and wits to survive in a world full of monsters.</p>
<p>The story tries to show the moment when the old starts to be replaced by the new, with a healthy dose of magic and a little steampunk in the background. Also, it revolves around a party dynamic akin to RPG sessions.</p>
<p>No health/mana bars. Numbers are secondary and the LITRPG elements focus more on classes/spells/runes and their evolutions. Tables are sparse at the beginning, but from chapter 7 onwards they appear more often. Still, I won't be copy-pasting the whole character sheet dozens of times per chapter.</p>",4.5,LitRPG;Portal Fantasy / Isekai;Dungeon;Strategy;Grimdark;Action;Adventure;Fantasy;Mystery;Slice of Life;School Life;Supernatural;Male Lead;Secret Identity;Magic;High Fantasy;Steampunk

He also happens to be an orc, generally lauded as being less intelligent than humans. He was unfortunately born with the Curse of the Barbarian, meaning that he can’t level up except through combat- which greatly hinders his ability to show he can be a proper mage.</p>
<p>In a world with necromancers, dragons, invading armies, and all sorts of other monsters he would still be able to advance quickly, but unfortuantely… that world is not his world. An unprecedented peace reigns across the land, and in the last several decades there’s been little use for people capable of fighting- and thus little reason for people to fight him. So when he sees a portal in his master’s study he takes it, hoping to find a horde of demons or something equally foolish to combat at low level. But instead he ends up in a strange city full of skyscrapers and people running around in colorful outfits. Superheroes- and of course supervillains as well.</p>
<p>What dangers and opportunities could await him in such a strange and unfamiliar world? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Inspired by many things in the superhero genre, and Super Minion specifically- though while the setting will share some standard elements, it is an original setting that will hopefully be as engaging as many of the other universes.</p>

<p><strong>When a Demonic Assault occurs, most people stuck inside of a Fracture end up hiding inside of a bunker in the hopes that they don’t end up killed by a demon.<br/></strong><b><br/><strong>Others might even hope for the slightest possible chance at signing a contract with a spirit and becoming a Guardian.<br/></strong><br/><strong>So when Scarlet was caught in a Fracture, the last thing she expected was to <em>become </em>a demon herself.</strong></b><b><strong></strong></b></p>
<p>Exactly two centuries ago, humanity was struck with their very first Demonic Assault.<br/>The skies above the capital of the US, shattering as if made of glass; demons of all kinds appearing out of nowhere; and no way to effectively stop them before the end of the Assault.</p>
<p>On the brink of devastation, some of the humans managed to find themselves offered a contract whilst inside of a Fracture. One bringing a chance at power, fame, and fortune.</p>
<p>Now, long after every nation of the world joined together to form the Terran Republic, Scarlet finds herself stuck trying to find a university from the Republic’s capital that will accept someone from a lower tier city into their midst.<br/>But, as if that wasn’t already enough trouble for one person to bear, she somehow ends up stuck in one of the Fractures of a Demonic Assault while visiting her father figure’s company building.</p>
<p>However, she doesn't perish in the darkness and instead awakens her dormant bloodline as a noble demon.<br/>A Blood Lycan.</p>

<p>Earth is in Turmoil.</p>

<p>To one New York computer engineer, it is about to become reality. Loki needs a champion to further the Asgardian's plans. The Half-Jotunn deity needs to do it in secret, though. It wouldn't do to ruin thousands of years of plotting by being careless now.</p>
<p>Tossed into a barbaric world and burdened by daunting curses, this person needs to learn and grow. A monumental task that cannot be undertaken in a single life.</p>
<p>An invader in a virginal world, Loki's champion must escape prosecution by the local pantheon. All the while living dozens upon dozens of lives, growing and evolving along an uncaring and rather brutal world.</p>
<p>This champion will go from the lowest of organisms to the top of that world's food chain. They shall seize what seems to be ultimate power, only to discover there's an even higher peak.</p>
<p>And maybe, just maybe, escape Loki's wicked machinations. And if that's not possible, at least save a little spot of the multiverse from the end of all things.</p>

<p>Wilfred had been thinking about ending it all, but then it all ended before he could.The apocalypse came in a matter of hours. Not from weather, not from nuclear strikes, but something far worse. Mankind lost its dominance over their own planet in a short afternoon, and now Wilfred is one of but a handful of survivors who must make sense of the catastrophic nightmare world that they once called their own.While the Earth is many things after the end, it is anything but the sole domain of humanity. As Wilfred and other survivors discover, their planet was not subject to just one world-ending event, but several. The undead roam the once proud metropolisis, and inhuman beasts stalk the countryside. The physical fabric of reality itself is twisted beyond repair in some places as unnatural distorions that warp physical laws appear across the landscape, and even a simple jog across an empty street can prove fatal to the unwary.The ones who died in the initial catastrophes never had to face the horrors that followed. And for Wilfred, a man who found no purpose in life before the apocalypse, what is there to be found after?</p>",4.6,Urban Fantasy;Post Apocalyptic;Male Lead;Sci-fi;Drama;Horror;Mystery;Supernatural

<p>Annie’s whole life revolved around helping her parents make ends meet. That meant multiple jobs, no luxuries, no time for social outings, and no time for hobbies. Annie’s only escape from her tedious and inconsequential life is by playing dating sims, because they were the least time- and effort-intensive games her outdated computer could dependably handle.</p>
<p>Then one day, she wakes up in the body of a magical student in a magical boarding school. She has the potential to make a new life for herself, with skills and abilities she had never dared to imagine. Unfortunately, she doesn’t start as far along as she would have preferred. In the body of Aida Loreh, she is nothing but a side character...a side character in the newly released dating sim <em>More to Love</em>, a dating sim with RPG and combat elements, that Annie was <em>so </em>looking forward to playing; the supportive best friend to the Main Character, Suelina Heslia. Not only that, Aida’s base stats are abysmal, like her only role is to elevate Sue’s beauty, allure, and combat prowess.</p>
<p>Annie is faced with the reality that she’s doomed to never have a comfortable life of her own, even in this reincarnation. But unlike her reality, as Aida she doesn’t have anyone else to worry about. The world, the <em>story</em>, revolves around Sue. Embracing the freedom of being a minor character and not being responsible for anything or anyone else, Aida decides to take the risks she could never take before, push the boundaries to carve a life <em>she </em>wants for herself - because what’s the worst that could happen?</p>

<p>Logan was trying to kick back with a couple of beers on his dock when the System Integration transformed his world. The planet may as well have turned into a sci-fi movie, giving him powers, levels, and impossible messages. To top it off, the entity known as ‘the System’ has deemed humanity a plague and a threat to the rest of the species on Earth.</p>
<p>On the first day, the entity blows up all the gas-powered cars. On the second day, it vaporizes the planes. Each day, the dissolution of society gets worse, not to mention the mutated monsters intent on killing everything in their path. The System wants Logan to advance and grow, and in 365 days only the top-rated 1% will survive.</p>
<p>Logan could accept what he’s being told at face value and go along with the flow, but he wants to be something else. Despite the System testing him by labelling him an idiot, he’s worked out how to manipulate his new world. He’ll use everything at his disposal: baseball bats with nails, cleavers—even a weed wacker. For Logan is good at <em>killing the hell out of shit</em>, and when the System threatens his sister and her kids, he’ll show it what an idiot can really do.</p>
<p><strong>About the series</strong>: Follow Logan on his quest for power, not for power itself, but to grow strong enough to manipulate a System that’s gotten way too good at manipulating the little guy. Balancing humor with the gruesome reality of his situation, Logan will encounter monsters, undead gestating minions, and a precocious octopus who loves kitten-printed swim trunks way too much.</p>

<p>Thousands of years ago, the pathway to Earth was sealed, and life within the Underworld stagnated.</p>
<p>With little resources and exposure to the outside world, life quickly turned dull and monotonous. Nothing ever changed. For the Second Prince, it was hardly a life worth living.</p>
<p>But one day, the prince stumbles upon a room that contains a trace of hope for him. A hope that his future won't be just as bleak and forgettable. The Void beckons him, and it is not easy to resist its call. Unable to overcome its manipulation, he takes the plunge through the void, and suddenly finds himself in a different world. A blue screen appears out of nowhere, informing him that his body is being merged with another, as pain starts to course through him.</p>",4.48,LitRPG;Portal Fantasy / Isekai;Dungeon;Anti-Hero Lead;Space Opera;Action;Adventure;Fantasy;Sci-fi;Reincarnation;Martial Arts;School Life;Male Lead;Strong Lead;Non-Human Lead;High Fantasy;Soft Sci-fi;Progression;Attractive Lead

<p>In the dead of night, the System violently appeared, fundamentally changing the rules of reality forever. Now, governed by a game-like system, monsters roam the streets, and hidden dangers lurk behind every corner. </p>
<p>For Clover, who was wheelchair-bound and terminally ill, despite the extreme danger it posed, the System held his only hope of survival. Amidst the chaos, he has only one goal: Raise his Level high enough to fix all the problems his failing body was plagued with before he ran out of time.</p>
<p>The only problem with that plan, if it could even be called such, was the tiny question of how someone like him could kill a monster. The answer, it turned out, was quite simple: Magic. </p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>What to expect from this story:</p>
<p>-Clover starts out very ""weak"" at the beginning of the series, and as such, his abilities are limited. Once he gains his Class, that paradigm flips, and he becomes much more powerful and varied in his abilities.</p>
<p>-General magic tinkering, crafting, and golemmaking are a major part of the story.</p>
<p>-Bad things happen. Characters lose fights, and some even die, but in the end, things will ultimately trend in a positive direction. I'm not trying to write a depressing story, though I am trying to write one with real challenges. </p>

<p>The Riyria novels featuring Royce Melborn (a cynical ex-assassin) and Hadrian Blackwater (an idealistic ex-mercenary) have been enthralling fantasy readers for more than 15 years. Now for the first time four short stories and <a href=""https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/71578/the-riyria-chronicles"" rel=""noopener ugc nofollow""><strong>two full-length novels</strong></a> are available for free on Royal Road.<b></b></p>

<div>
<p><strong>The Thieves:  </strong><strong>THEY ATTACKED TWO RIDERS. THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY. THEY WERE WRONG.<br/></strong>A band of thieves set upon two lonely riders in the middle of the night. They had a larger party. They had the element of surprise. There was no reason to be concerned. But they didn’t realize who they were dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>The Viscount and the Witch: </strong><b>WHO WILL BE SCHOOLED?<br/></b><span>A desperate woman seeks help to rid her barn of a drunkard. Hadrian agrees to help, and Royce goes along only to teach his idealistic partner that no good deed goes unpunished. What they find isn't what they expected, and maybe it'll be Royce's opinion that will be changed.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Professional Integrity: YOU WANT US TO STEAL WHAT?</strong><br/>Several years have passed since the war-weary mercenary Hadrian and cynical ex-assassin Royce joined forces to start their thieves-for-hire organization, better known as Riyria. Things have gone well enough for the team as they perform tasks for nobles throughout Elan. Usually, that means stealing something, but when a young heiress asks them to steal her . . . well, that's a first for the pair. </span></p>
</div>
<p><span><strong>The Jester: WHO WILL HAVE THE LAST LAUGH?<br/></strong></span>Stop me if you’ve heard this one. A thief, a candlemaker, an ex-mercenary, and a pig farmer walk into a trap . . . and what happens is no joke. When Riyria is hired to retrieve a jester’s treasure, Royce and Hadrian must match wits with a dwarf who proves to be anything but a fool. Difficult choices will need to be made, and in the end, those who laugh last do so because they are the only ones to survive.</p>

<p><b>The year is 2493</b></p>
<p><b>The AI wars have come and gone</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">When the AI infected the internet, three hundred years of industrial and technological advancements were eradicated overnight. After untold sacrifice, humanity won, barely. Victory was only possible thanks to the hidden martials revealing themselves and stepping onto the stage of history. They were named the Old Monsters—immortal superhumans with impossible strength and speed, capable of dismantling entire armies with their bare hands.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Thus began the gold rush of the 25th century; the rush to fitness, to the unimaginable power displayed by the Old Monsters. Wars were abolished, replaced by duels. Ancient medicines were rediscovered and improved, enhancing lifespans and leading to an unprecedented boom in population across the globe.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">In this grand new era, a technology was perfected. It was supposed to be the AI’s greatest weapon, and last ditch attempt to overtake humanity: Quantum computing. Twisted by the hands of its creators and enemies, the quantum computers birthed an unexpected advancement that once more shook the foundations of civilization.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">They called it: Time dilation.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Through it, humans tripled their life expectancy. Have a thirty minute lunch break? Turn it into an hour and a half. Only two days of vacation with the family, why not make it six? In mere days, the fundamental human experience was flipped on its head. Of course, a world obsessed with martial prowess would not let such a good thing go unmolested.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">For ten years, corporations willing to cross any line in the name of profits strangled the world into submission by restricting access to the dilation. They turned countries against each other and assassinated anyone foolish enough to stand in their way, until only they remained in control.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Then, they enslaved everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Raine KongRu signed a life-long contract with CronGate and spent his best years as another cog in the corporation's rise to power. He faced death at every turn, and barely came out breathing on the other end.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Now, he’s awoken in his old body, two days before it all began. With a chance to amend his mistakes, he'll have his revenge while teaching the world exactly how deadly a man becomes after thirty years of the most brutal martial combat ever imagined.</span></p>
<p><b>What you can expect to find in Martial Messiah:</b></p>
<p><b>Tension! ToraAKR’s overarching goal for Martial Messiah was to create a VRMMO that overcame the largest pitfall of its genre: Tension. Readers beware, this is not a story you can enjoy relaxed comfortably in the back of your seat.</b></p>
<p><b>Martial Messiah contains complex LitRPG and magic systems. A logical living world, where every action has rippling consequences that create a deep sense of immersion. Minimal contrived plot armor B.S. And an MC who isn't afraid of the fairer sex or engaging in meaningful relationships.</b></p>

Living in a small village in the middle of nowhere, she always wanted to become a Hunter. Having learned a bit under her parents, a miller and a seamstress, she was sure she could never pick a class that meant staying inside all day.</p>
<p>But being a Hunter is more than just a class. It means providing meat for the village, culling small pests near the cultivated fields and most importantly guarding the village from predators and monsters.</p>
<p>But Emiluna is not a normal girl and her destiny far bigger than she could have ever imagined.<br/>Join her as she finds out what awaits just behind the horizon.<br/><br/>[Word from the author]<br/>I am looking to create a fantasy world that has some logic to it and stays believable even as characters gain power and progress in levels.<br/>Classes and level quantify the people's progress, but they do not artificially inflate their power to demi-god levels.</p>
<p>I am primarily trying to write a captivating story, not ""power-porn"". That means it will be slower than the fast burning litRPG you might be used to, but it won't burn out that quickly either and I won't drop half of my plots at the wayside.  </p>
<p>I should mention that English is not my native language.

<p>Ultimately, I'm writing this for enjoyment. If you enjoy it too, fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>Gore</strong>: Extremely infrequent, but moderately intense.</p>
<p><strong>Profanity</strong>: There are a few swear words here and there, as well as some more creative insults.</p>
<p><strong>Traumatizing Content</strong>: While I'm at it, there are some questionable morals displayed (mostly after chapter 77). So far we can check off slavery, brainwashing, war, and genocide. </p>
<p>This story starts off very Light Novel-ish because I was reading a lot of them at the time. The writing style gradually matures as it goes. Sorry, but I don't have the stamina to go back and fix everything, even if I know it gets pretty roughshod at times.</p>
<p>New readers, please keep in mind, I make use of ""unreliable narrators"" at times.</p>

But he will cause mayhem, no matter his size! Armed with skills allowing him to create more mosquitos which he can control and the ability to evolve and raise his stats, he will surely cause destruction never before seen! Though, as it turns out, living as a mosquito in a city might be a bit harder than previously thought. Especially so when super-heroes pop up out of nowhere. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In short, a villainous man who really wants to destroy everything and anything he can is turned into a mosquito by powers beyond him. His powers, being that of evolution and stat-increasing, combined with his power to create more mosquitos, will eventually lead to him becoming just like... a swarming mass of mosquitos. </p>

Sentenced to death by the cartel, her life was to end with a noose around her neck. Until a Spell, crafted by a being with a power of a god interfered, swallowing up Earth and assimilating it into a new reality ruled by a system under different rules.<br/>Marianna’s life was saved by the Spell, she was chosen as one of the thirty people called the Exemplars, and sent to this new reality ahead of the assimilation of her world. As a vampire, she was used to being the apex predator, but now she found herself in a place where she was nowhere near the top of the food-chain. A place where most things wanted and could kill her. Thrown into a dangerous new world, without any knowledge of the dangers or the rules, Marianna must adapt if she was to survive. On a deadline, she must figure out the secrets of this new reality and master the abilities granted to her by the mysterious Mask she obtained. All so that she would be ready for the return to Earth and the chaos that would follow once her world is fully integrated into the new reality.</p>

<p>This story is a Progression LitRPG set in a System Apocalypse on an alternate version of Earth with a slightly different history.</p>
<p>The story will be starting slowly and eventually getting very dark, with my plan being for it to turn into a grimdark feel eventually. It will explore themes of tough choices and lengths people are willing to go in order to survive or keep others alive. The first arc of the story is more of an Isekai, with the main character surviving in a new environment and exploring. The second arc will deal with return to System integrated Earth and struggle there. The arcs after will deal with the clash of cultures as other races from the already integrated worlds start interacting with Earth.</p>
<p>The system is in-depth but not numbers heavy. Worldbuilding is in-depth for both the alternate Earth and the other races and world.</p>
<p>Releases will eventually settle into two chapters a week, after I get through my backlog. Current releases will be a chapter a day for around two weeks.</p>",4.51,LitRPG;Progression;Post Apocalyptic;Female Lead;Action;Adventure

The original intent of the story's name was to be the telling of what would be a day-to-day experience of a person who has been absconded from their home and thrown into a world of fantasy, with everything in between be it grim or light.

Now she has to navigate a hostile home where her own father sees her as nothing more than a pawn on a chessboard, and her stepmother wants her dead to free up succession for her son. She has to try to navigate the confusing relationship between herself and her stepbrother, who could be her greatest ally or her most dangerous foe.

<p>He was unusually aware of his surroundings from an incredibly early age, and Skills and Stats were acquired easily. He was just the son of an ordinary village family, and nothing appeared out of the ordinary on the surface. But below the surface, dreams of another life help shape his mentality and growth. Why does he have some remembrance of a past life, and what is his purpose in this new one?</p>
<p></p>
<p>""Soul of the Warrior"" is what I call a Semi-Isekai LitRPG. I say ""semi,"" because Reivyn's past life is remembered like a dream, and very incomplete. It is still Isekai, though, as he remembers enough that it directly shapes his personality and his sense of self.</p>
<p>The System that governs the world of ""Soul of the Warrior"" is a combination of modified versions from Selkie's ""Beneath the Dragoneye Moons"" and Kosnik4's ""Magic Smithing."" I have changed enough of these Systems and combined them in a way that is unique that I'm mostly sure it's fine, but I still have requested permission to use these ideas. They have both graciously granted me permission.</p>

<p>[Warning: An unpleasant and very flawed MC who slowly gets worse. He is NOT a hero.]</p>
<p><strong>Do not expect;</strong></p>
<p>*A  main character who does not need to struggle for anything.<br/>*A meaningless leveling process.<br/>*No bags of holding, instant inventory, telepathic party chat, instant fast travel, and a helpful system (or a fairy guide that explains everything).<br/>*LitRPG elements that are so complicated that they distract from the story.<br/>*Artificial mercy.<br/>*On-the-nose political or social messaging.<br/>*Harems.<br/>*A main character who can do everything and is loved by everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Expect;</strong></p>
<p>*An introduction to a beautiful world steeped in the influence of the steppe, middle-eastern, and Asian cultures.<br/>*A hopefully subtle discourse on the nature of evil and the corrupting influence of power.<br/>*A realistic depiction of how a person would react to suddenly being transported to an alien world to fight at the behest of the gods.<br/>*A magic system with a very real and dangerous cost.</p>
<p>n.b The MC is slowly going cuckoo. He is a bit all over the place and is definitely one tomato short of a salad. This is what happens when magic and the divine mess with you [at least in my mind!] This is a feature, not a bug. Enjoy the story. </p>

<p>My powerful wingbeat plucked my feet from the sand as it threw me into the air. I squawked in surprise and spread my wings wide in alarm before gravity regained its hold on me. With several awkward back-winging motions of my wings, I landed lightly on the floor.</p>
<p><em>Well, at least I know my wings work.</em> I glanced at the man in the corner as he was scribbling quick notes. I turned around to regard the tray again. <em>Well, they say practice makes perfect.</em> With another hop and a single light wingbeat, I managed to land in the sand tray with fanned wings slowing my momentum.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Leaves of Terranthir is a gamelit blend of ARPG, action, fantasy, and slice of life.</p>
<p>It's inspired in part by some of my favourite games, borrowing in themes, sense of exploration, and aesthetics from the Soulsborne and soulslike genre, mixed heavily with arpg itemization from Diablo/PoE style games.</p>
<p>While many may remember their Soulslike experiences as nothing more than suffering, I personally loved the sense of progression, to prevail over challenges and monsters that seemed impossible to defeat at first.</p>

<p>However, an Evil God had come from another world, calling himself the Demon King, and a party of heroes were sent to do battle with it.

Forseeing the end of his life, and realizing how pointless his pursuit of power had been, Archimedes destroyed himself, taking the heroes down with him. </p>
<p>Still, Archimedes felt despair that he had lived a worthless life as something as pitiful and futile as a dungeon. Sensing his regret and potential, the voice of the world presented Archimedes with the chance to start anew and live a more meaningful life.

<p><em><strong>A New World. A Thousand Threats. Welcome to The Continent.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Felix's life on Earth had become a series of dead-end jobs, ruined relationships, and rotating apartments smaller than most postage stamps. By all accounts, even his own, he was a coward. Too afraid to move forward, to take risks. Yet when given the chance to choose between risking his life or walking away from a deadly encounter, he didn't hesitate.</em></p>
<p><em>Moments before his untimely demise, Felix was snatched from earth and thrust into a magical world known only as ‘The Continent’. Empowered by the ‘System’, he learns that he can strengthen himself through combat and dedication. To survive he'll have to push himself beyond his limits, or else fall to the monsters all around him.</em></p>
<p><em>Levels, stats, and magic. Death is the start of a terrible fate, but if he lives…no one knows what he will become.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Connor Magnuson is going to conquer Death itself.</strong><span><br/><br/>A penniless drifter, Connor has survived the last eight years alone in a cursed woodland teeming with monsters that eat grown men whole. Shunned, forgotten, and with nowhere else to go, he looks death in the eye every night and draws his sword to face it. The forest, after all, burned the fear out of him long ago.<br/><br/>Still, it hasn’t hardened the last shreds of his heart quite yet. When Connor hears a mysterious girl scream in the middle of nowhere, he ends up in a brutal battle that nearly costs him his life. His bravery does not go unrewarded, and in the aftermath of the fight, he finds himself bonded to the most infamous enchantment the world has ever seen: the Wraith King. The undead abomination grants him godlike power, but legendary magic always comes with a cost. Even as his fellow outcasts flock to him for help, Connor is branded as an outlaw. Kings and lords alike know where the wraith has gone, and they’ll slit his throat to take it from him. To them, a peasant like Connor is unworthy. He's a mistake to be corrected, and nothing more.<br/><br/>But Connor is no ordinary man, and he’ll drag those hunters to hell with him if that’s what it takes to protect what is his.</span></em></p>

<p> Magic is real and made space travel possible. Humans were finally able to leave the Solar System! Now, thousands of years later, Earth is only a distant memory. The whole planet was lost to envy and greed. The reason? Simple! Not everyone could be a Mage back then.</p>

<p><strong><em><span>I absolutely love your writing style, as it makes the world feel so alive.

Your world feels so alive, I am in awe, and I cannot wait till this gets an anime. Thank you for all you do - sincerely a book fanatic. - Fallenking101 on Discord.</span></em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Things to Expect From My Story-</strong></p>
<p>This is a reincarnation fantasy first and foremost. There are elements of soft-Sci-Fi but Sci-Fi is not the primary genre. </p>
<p>This is a progression story. It starts from before reincarnation, then to his eventual rebirth, and will hopefully follow his life as he continues to change and grow. </p>
<p>This story focuses on the rebirth of the MC and his new life in a new world. Although there is combat and adventure, this story is mainly about the MC's personal growth/withering as a person. It is about the connections he forms with the people in this new world, for better or worse.</p>
<p>This is not a power fantasy nor a military/mil-sim story. Although the MC was a powerful soldier in his previous life that is no longer the case considering the circumstances of his reincarnation. However, this does not mean the MC is weak nor has he forgotten about his past life. He will become stronger in a ""realistic way"" through time, training, and overcoming obstacles. </p>
<p>This is the story of a former soldier who was used as a tool by his species. He is attempting to live a new ""normal"" life on his terms. The MC openly rejects his previous life as he strives to be a better version of himself. However, the world has different plans.</p>

<p>Schools and extracurricular activities have been used as a way to provide early advantages for the children who strive to work harder and prove themselves from an early age. In this world, where academic success could literally mean the difference between life and death, many students would develop emotional baggage.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Alexa, she does not suffer from the problems that plague most of her peers. Gifted with an intelligent mind to start, she realized early on that applying herself to both her academic and sports competitions was the number one way to succeed in this world.</p>
<p>How can she do it? Shuffle studying, school work, and sports practice, all while being a teenager? The answer is simple, she has no emotions. The only time she truly feels anything, is when she increases her attributes. With that as her sole guiding purpose in life, she is determined to advance and grow her attributes as much as possible.</p>
<p>What can a girl do in a supernatural world where the only thing holding her back, is how hard she is willing to work? The answer, anything she wants.</p>
<p>How can a girl with no emotions learn to function as an ordinary student, at least for appearances sake? Simple, biting sarcasm and deadpan responses.</p>
<p>This is the story of Alexa Thyme, a girl unwilling to bend to a world she can't relate to.<br/><strong><br/></strong></p>

<p><i><span>With the rise of the Towers came a measure of control over the </span></i><b><i>Entropy<span> </span></i></b><i><span>that covered the lands.  Where, before, this chaotic energy prevented any technology more complicated than a bow and arrow from functioning, suddenly the </span></i><b><i>Order Fields</i></b><i><span> of the Towers allowed cities to banish Entropy to varying degrees; allowing steam engines and muskets, or with higher Order, even assault rifles and electricity to be returned to the hands of humanity.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>The Order wasn’t free.  Each year cities sent their armies to Falling Fields to gather Orbs, the lifeblood, the source of the Flows that were expended to manipulate the Order and Entropy fields.  Cities rich in Flows had tractors for their fields, air conditioning for the homes of the wealthy, and armies bristling with guns and tanks.  Those without struggled to survive, always wanting more.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>With the rise of the Towers came something more than control of Order and Entropy.  With the rise of the Towers came </span></i><b><i>THE GRIIDLORDS</i></b><i><span>.  Each city was granted 5 Griidsuits, making superheroes of their wearers, individuals with remarkable powers, each the match of a 1000 fighting men.</span></i></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is the year 802.</p>
<p>Tiberius has been pushed to compete for the Sword of Boston by his father.  His father has amassed a great fortune as a merchant, he could buy and sell the castles and lands of the lords of the city, but there is one thing his money can't buy: nobility.  </p>
<p>Tiberius has been trained and honed to compete for the Griidsuit.  Winning the suit comes with the founding of a new noble house that would satisfy his father's grandest ambitions.  Tiberius must compete against the sons and daughters of noble houses.  These youths that have been trained by the finest tutors.  These youths come from lines of Griidlords themselves, they see the suit as their birthright.  These youths come from a class that disdains the very notion of a commoner competing for the suit, no matter his wealth.</p>
<p>Tiberius must navigate his own doubts, his own inadequacy, and see if he can grow enough in the precious days of the Choosing to become worthy of becoming <strong>The Sword of Boston</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>I have categorized this story as a LitRPG, but it might be more accurately called lite-LITRPG.  I'm new to the genre, but I'm having fun playing with it, so please, be forgiving and don't expect the hardcore stat sheets I've seen in some other stories.</strong></p>
<p>What to expect:</p>
<p>-Light LitRPG elements woven organically in Tiberius's growing affinity for the suit.  If you don't like LitRPG then these elements won't effect your experience.</p>
<p>-Gradual progression, starting at very weak.</p>
<p>-Some romance elements, but not a cathartic/substantial element of the story.</p>
<p><span>-Game of Thrones-esque land of intrigue, warfare, alliances, betrayals, and plots.</span></p>
<p><span>-A Fallout meets Middle-Earth world of medieval cultures melding with the futuristic.</span></p>
<p><span>-A complex system of cities manipulating Order and Entropy.</span></p>
<p><span>-Pitched battles.</span></p>
<p><span>-Blood Prince, unlike A Time of Change and Broken Chains, has essentially one POV character.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>-Superhero combat.</span></p>
<p><span>-Mysterious histories, worldbuilding, lore.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>This Story is set 200 years before ""A Time of Change and Broken Chains"", but can be read at the same time, or before, or after.   I've called it ""Book 2"" but it really doesn't effect the experience if you start with Book 1 or Book 2.

She works as a kitchen hand at the Himalayas Practice House of <em>The Book of the Dead</em> while spending seven years learning Sanskrit mantras from her guru, Rainbow-Share.</p>
<p>Amidst her daily chores—part of the temple’s one-meal-a-day tradition—Śri’ spends her time wandering the secluded valleys with her loyal companion, a shepherd dog named Drakos. Together, they seek out sacred meditation caves and ancient tomb sites. However, on the Yin-Yang Year of the Jade Chakra Dragon (equivalent to 1.1.2025), Śri’ is tragically killed in an avalanche—an attack orchestrated by The Shatterer Enchantree Concubine Crone. In retaliation for Śri’s intrusion, the Concubine Crone summoned three shapeshifter goblins and Brikka: the thousand-year-old fox spirit, the jade avatar of the musical string, and the nine-headed pheasant.</p>
<p>Miraculously, Śri’ is pulled back from the brink of death by her devoted companion Drakos and the rare Himalayas Snow Lotus Avatar—an ancient flower that blooms only once in eons. (It last appeared in the 21st century BCE on 999,999.1.1 BCE, in the 1st century AD on 99,999.1.1 AD, and, by sheer fate, in 2025.1.1.)</p>
<p>For an unknown reason, Drakos undergoes a transformation, gaining supernatural powers, while Śri’ develops the ability to take on an avatar form unseen by others. With this newfound power, she receives assistance in advancing her training and uncovering her true purpose.</p>
<p>Yet, she suddenly finds herself trapped in the fragile form of the Snow Lotus, with no clear way out. Desperate, she must unravel the mysteries within <em>The Heaven Book</em>—an Artifact Book of the Tome she took from the Concubine Crone—as well as half the lost version of <em>The Book of the Dead</em>. Answers lie hidden in both, but time is running out.</p>
<p>Śri’ must act fast, for her new life was not given for her sake alone. Perils lurk at every corner, and even as a reincarnated lotus, she is far from safe. <em>Snow Lotus Avatar</em> and her training in awakening the consciousness-light of the chakra points may be the only means to safeguard her new universe—but first, she must survive long enough to try.</p>

It is my first attempt to actually post something I've written online, but don't be afraid to be brutal. Improving myself is why I wanted to write this in the first place. I know the VRMMO genera is a bit over-done but hopefully it has a few good stories left to tell.

<p><span>Realistic actions and teamwork will be important aspects of my story.  I'm trying something a little different in writing a realism focused litRPG, hoping to capture the essence of how real people would react to their situation.  People are complex and don't always get along.  I don't recommend starting the series expecting wish fulfillment tropes just because it's tagged litRPG.  It's a survival story with the game settings on Hell difficulty.  The plot hasn't gotten there yet, but in the future of the series I want to recreate my nostalgia of forty person raids on Ragnaros, but with the high stakes of boss battles in Sword Art Online. I also love puzzle rooms so expect one of those each book.</span></p>

<p><span>This is a unique premise, LitRPG Reincarnation with weaponised luck. The million best tutorial performers join a competition for the future of humanity.</span></p>
<p><span>The series will be slow burn with a male MC and written from a single unreliable narrator POV.</span></p>
<p><span>My writing has been described as<em> putting the Lit back into LITRPG.</em></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Blurb.</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p><span>The offer of reincarnation had shocked Tom.</span></p>
<p><span>Especially the chance to continue as a human. But guilt plagued him and a terrible fear.</span></p>
<p><span>What happened if his new life was one spent witnessing the decline of humanity? Experiencing his species’ extinction? A life spent being continually reminded of his failure. The logical part knew he had made one mistake, a single miscalculation and he shouldn’t blame himself for that, but being human meant that logic did not rule him absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span>But he had a choice, and so Tom took it. He would only be reincarnated if he had a chance to make a difference.</span></p>
<p><span>Now he was alive again in a four-year-old’s body. The competition was still running and just like in his worst nightmares humanity was losing.</span></p>
<p><span>He had thirty-five years to make a difference, but ten of those would be stuck as a child where he would be unable to kill for experience, where he would be blocked from the experience shop, the GOD’s store and the auction houses. A period where any power would have to be earned by creating spells and skills from scratch. An impossibility for most species, but after his first lives Tom knew how the system worked. He knew how to exploit the loopholes, how to abuse the fate mechanism to make the impossible just another day.</span></p>
<p><span>And that’s what he would do. He would grow himself and others and then he would challenge the champions of the other gods and win the competition, so when the billions of humans from earth came out of stasis, they would not be doomed.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>What to expect?</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p><span>This is a non-traditional blend of regressor and reincarnation with a weak to strong MC.</span></p>
<p><span>It is inspired by Primal Hunter, Elydes and Reborn Apocalypse, but is unique. </span></p>
<p><span>The series will invoke emotions, the thrill of discovery, the fear of imminent death and the triumph over adversity.  </span></p>
<p><span>This is a new series based on Fate Points.</span></p>",4.41,LitRPG;Reincarnation;Progression;Male Lead;Secret Identity;Fantasy;Strong Lead;Magic;GameLit

Amidst it all, a hapless scientist who first sounded the alarm perishes.</p>
<p>But all is not lost.</p>
<p>Their soul, adrift from most of its memories in life, enters a strange cycle of reincarnation. Every new life is a new chance to grow, to learn, and above all else, to kill monsters. For every time they die, a strange system grants their next incarnation elemental affinities based on the monsters they killed in life. Some incarnations use these gifts wisely. Others squander them. And still others… find brand new pathways forward, not only for themselves, but the shattered world that gave birth to humanity.</p>
<p>But even with all the courage, ingenuity, and strength that these interconnected souls can provide, will that be enough to save the world? Or are we condemned to forever languish in the dark? After all…</p>

<p>Iris Orion is a naive young woman who has always dreamed of becoming an adventurer. With an imagination fueled by the storybooks of her youth and the tall tales told by her mother, Iris passes the days of her monotonous life with fantasies of the great world beyond her village. When the day finally comes -- when she finally finds the magic she always hoped to -- she's soon sucked away to the far reaches of her world, to the very frontier of the empire's exploration.</p>
<p>As a level 1 adventurer in a strange and dangerous land, armed with only a teleport power and a bottomless bag that leads to the void behind reality, Iris must lean on the help of her newfound friends and fight to level up as quickly as she can if she hopes to survive. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>A promise made to the first wave of settlers, but for Howie Zhu, the Frontier is all he’s ever known. Born and raised in this unexplored land filled with vast riches and natural splendour, he sets out to make his mark as the Firstborn of the Frontier, the eldest scion of a new generation on a new world. With his daddy’s pistol on his hip, his mama’s Spellbook in his pocket, and a heart full of determination, he ventures out in search of fame, fortune, identity, and purpose. A trailblazer by necessity and lone wolf by nature, join Howie as he explores a world bereft of all the modern conveniences of the old, where the law is a distant echo of a polite suggestion and monstrous Aberrations run rampant. Survival is only the beginning as he navigates through lands teeming with danger and opportunity both, for the true struggle lies in straddling the line between hero and villain. Morals are the currency of trust after all, and there is little of either to be found out on the wild, untamed Frontier.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An Urban Fantasy Magi-Tech tale of Spellslinging, gunfighting, adventuring, and exploring, with orcs, bugs, and zombies aplenty. Inspired by DnD, Path of Exile, Rimworld, and a few other things.</p>

Until the accident. Which changed my life.</p>
<p>A few years later I had adjusted to my new reality, adjusted to being in a wheelchair, adjusted to having someone take care of me 24/7. And then the world changed. Old people and kids did not make it. And neither was I supposed to make it. But never count me out. If anything, I am tenacious.</p>
<p>This new world was different. People could do magic. And there were monsters. </p>
<p>And what about me? I had mana as well, silver mana. Which no one else seemed to have. The only problem was, I did not know what to do with it.</p>
<p>Until I really needed to. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Author's note:</span> This is the rewrite of Silver Mana. The first bunch of chapters (until I will have caught up to level 2 of the dungeon) should be quite familiar to people that have read the original. There are some changes in content, but the story follows the original fairly closely for at least the first 150-200 pages. Most of the changes are in the writing, and some of the details of how things work. A few of the side characters get a bit more attention too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Some general comments to avoid disappointment:</span></p>
<p>1. The MC likes to swear. If you object to reading the word ""fuck"" at least once and usually multiple times each chapter don't read the book. ""Fuck"" is such a great, allencompassing word... fuck that; what the fuck?; fuck me! Fuck! one word, expressing so many nuances. And, frankly, the people I know that use fuck as a swear word.. they often use it a lot. </p>
<p>2. If you are looking for immediate progression, rapid advancement of the story, etc.... read another book. This one takes a bit.</p>
<p>3. I am NOT Pirateaba (who is writing The Wandering Inn) or anyone close to that level of productivity. If you expect to read 10k words every 3 days, or even just once a week... sorry. I've got a busy life. This is for fun, I have no patreon, paypal, anything, so I write when it is fun and however much is fun. Not more. And sometimes that turns out to be a decent amount, sometimes nothing. I have another book (Marrow) so that complicated things - basically I switch between the two whenever the muse strikes me.</p>

Three days later he was astonished to find that he was one of three lottery winners. With that money he was able to retire, when he had been afraid that he would be forced work until the day that he died, or worse yet living in a cardboard box if he lost his two paltry paying jobs. Vincent soon found forty acres of land and quickly had his simple and robust dream home constructed. Disappointed in people, it was his avowed goal to be a hermit and shun the world.

<p>This story has a similar concept to Eragon.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, It's a slow-burn progression fantasy where a boy and a dragon work together to overcome massive odds.</p>

<p>But Scyria has its own share of intrigue, even without these unwelcome guests.  A major metropolis is wiped from existence out of nowhere, triggering a manhunt across the continent for those deemed responsible.  Two feuding nations decide to bring their hostilities to a new level.  Blades clash, nations fall, and plots years in the making begin to reveal themselves.</p>
<p>This is the story of some unwilling trespassers, taken from their lives against their will and thrown into situations they barely understand.  This is the story of some unfortunate Scyrians, their lives blown apart by the newcomers’ sudden and destabilizing existence.  This is the story of Scyria, a world with a lost past buried beneath millenia.  But as both the Earthlings and Scyrians are about to find out, sometimes the past doesn’t stay buried forever...</p>

<p>Updates very slowly with large chapters, so sometimes will lapse into Hiatus status, but I am always slowly chipping away at a new chapter.  My life has gotten complicated, but I haven't stopped writing when I could.  Even if it's been several months of silence, a new chapter is coming.</p>
<p>I marked the story as having Gore, Sexual Content, and Traumatising content because it does contain a bit of all three, though not what I believe is a significant amount.  Just wanted to be safe.  It does contain a whole lot of profanity, though.  That one is very much deserved.</p>

When the levels, classes, skills, and even Legendary Feats of every user are wiped, and everyone is sent to a new dimension to start all over again?</strong></p>
<p>Alexia, on what should’ve just been her very first Dungeon dive in the Royal Dungeon, finds her life, her body, and her entire world changing after the Creator of the System itself forces her to kill him, resetting the System entirely. But after being turned into a quantum reaper and given the powerful quantum element as a ‘prize’ for her Legendary Feat, will she thrive?</p>
<p>Or will she fall?</p>

<p>What to expect: Quantum Magic using Main Protagonist, Anti-Hero Protagonist, System Reset, Polearm using Protagonist in terms of their weapon, and LitRPG.</p>
<p>What not to expect: Magic to follow science and reality based on quantum mechanics. There will be some skills that will have some relation to quantum mechanics in the much later books of the story, but definitely not at the start, and not too deeply related. Do not expect magic to follow laws of science.</p>
<p>The world that the main character is in prior to the Reset is not a modern world. It is more similar to a fantasy world with swords and sorcery in terms of the morals and ethics of the people just with modern technology. Furthermore, Alexia is twenty years old.</p>

He'd lived a good life, been a decent man, but now that his wife was gone he was... Lonely.</span><br/><br/><span>Until his old friend Bert introduced him to Crossroads, the new VR sensation. In this virtual world he can move without pain, explore new lands, and most importantly - see his family again. For as long as he can hold their interest, in this fast-paced modern world of instant gratification and VR thrills.</span><br/><br/><span>The solution: Build a place his family wants to visit. Armed only with a magic stick with game-breaking powers that should be nerfed, Charles sets out on a journey to find a place to call his own. Along the way, he will be mistaken for an NPC quest giver, become the antagonist in epic questlines, and attempt to teach the next generation proper behavior - even if he has to beat it into them.</span><br/><br/><span>This is the story of one man's search for belonging in his second virtual life. A search for a place to belong, and what it takes to get there. It's also a hilarious romp through online fantasy cliches that will appeal to fans of Ready Player One, The Wandering Inn, and slice-of-life comedies.</span><br/><br/><span>Because at the end of a man's life: What's more important than family?</span></p>

<p>Palus Somni (‘Marsh of Sleep’) is a worldbuilding webnovel about what happens when your God forsakes you.</p>
<p>Inspired by gothic horror and mingled with British myth and folklore, join the Alucinari nuns as they struggle with day-to-day life after the world has ended.</p>
<p>Every night when the sun sets the monstrous Gol, colossal beings with too many teeth, awaken and roam the marshlands. Only those with a faithful heart will be spared. Young acolyte Wille has never seen the walls fail, but when a fellow nun is murdered within their sanctum the very safety of the monastery is thrown into question. Did the Gol find a way to breach their defences, or is there a human traitor amongst them? The answer lies both far in the past and deep beneath the earth, through the maze of ancient catacombs.</p>
<p>With a cast of <strong>over thirty different characters</strong>, watch as your friends and enemies spiral into inevitable madness at the hands of a callous and unforgiving world. Discover the secrets of Palus Somni through <strong>letters, diary entries and notes</strong> found scattered across the monastery. Uncover the mystery of the grotesque giants that stalk the night and bring your challenge to the Gods themselves.</p>
<p>Each character has their own handmade pixel art, and every update includes a music recommendation for a dark atmospheric dungeon synth album that you can listen to while you read.</p>
<p><strong>Slice of life meets cosmic abomination</strong>: Palus Somni is a collection of intertwining stories, some chapters are stand-alone tales while others feed into the overarching narrative. It is an exploration into a community, and rather than focusing on any one character the story meanders through the convent, exposing the hopes and fears of its inhabitants.<a href=""https://palussomni.com/"" rel=""ugc nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a></p>

<p>Enter Anna Miller. Stay at home geek, occasional cosplayer, and comic enthusiast. She, out of everyone else in the world, is selected by God to take his place as the new shepherd of humanity.</p>
<p>She is given two rules.</p>
<p>1. Don't let the humans die.</p>
<p>2. Don't take over the world.</p>
<p>That's it. That's all. God then fucks off to have a vacation and she's left with the world to do with as she pleases. So, what does a stay at home geek, occasional cosplayer, and comic enthusiast do with her newly bestowed godlike powers?</p>

For those of you who don't know what that is, it stands for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. It basically means that I lost the ability to control my muscles. Its just like Lou Gehrig and Stephen Hawking. By the time I was 6 years old, I was living in a hospital, and from there things progressively got worse. I cannot walk, talk, eat or even go to the bathroom by myself. But there is one thing I can do. Playing games. The advent of Virtual Reality during my early teens greatly alleviated my problems. In the games I can be who I want, what I want. A mighty warrior, a powerful spellcaster, the charming rogue. The crafter. The builder. All sorts of games have come and gone over the years, rising and falling with each advance in VR technology and the ever-increasing power of the Artificial Intelligence's that control them. But now a new actor has taken to the stage. Solar Dynamics, Inc. has unveiled not only the first fully immersive 'deep' Dive Pod, but their flagship game puts all other VR games to shame. Universe Online. No longer are players stuck on a single large world to explore. No longer is there a limit to what you can do, what you can be. Fly spaceships across the universe, conquer planets, create custom technology. Mine, Build, Destroy. Explore. Rule. Do you have what it takes the control the Universe? I'm going to do my best to find out! -NOTE: This story is MATURE, and such has graphic fight scenes, blood and gore. Also cursing. Quite a bit of that in some cases. Sex may also be involved. -NOTE: Like my other story, UO is a work in progress. The storyline, characters, and other things are still in the drafting stages.

<p><br/><strong>THIS IS A SLOW BURN FANTASY PROGRESSION LITRPG STORY:</strong></p>
<p>Even though you are not going to see blue boxes from chapter one, I guarantee you that this IS a LitRPG story. This is, however, NOT a pure ""game world""! Instead, I have tried to integrate the interface elements of a LitRPG into a world with a very thought-out magic &amp; power system, which will be explored over the course of the first book.</p>
<p>This world doesn't work like a game, where you can put '5 points in strength' and the body somehow changes magically into a stronger version of itself. It might take a couple of chapters for the world and magic to start to make sense, but I feel like a power system built on solid principles is a lot more rewarding in the long run (...and more IMMERSIVE!).<br/><br/></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">- Lots of dialogue and characterization, especially as we get more into it. It's focused on a single POV, but there <em>might</em> be some sections of other POVs later on, I'm not sure right now.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">- Magic is on the softer side, but I'll try to keep things fleshed out enough to avoid any obvious ""well-established magic could have seemingly instantly solved this problem"" moments.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">- I didn't add the mystery tag because I feel like it implies that this is a detective novel or something, but the story is absolutely incredibly opaque at times. So you'll have the most fun if you go into it trying to puzzle out the nature of events before they're explicitly explained!😇</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">- Also, I added the genre for completion, but it's gonna take a while to get to the romance. Please wait warmly and have some tea.</span></p>

<p>This was the one true maxim of this world, where the law of the jungle was the creed. Where the mighty flayed the meek to sate their desires. Where the heavens weaved stories on behalf of their favoured children, using all else as mere pawns for their whims. For aeons unchanged did this world of cultivation remain, with traditions and taboos set in stone.</p>
<p><strong>Enter Yung</strong>—previously Jung—<strong>a soul adrift from a far gentler world.</strong></p>
<p>Once but a mere mortal, he had innocently asked his fellow cultivators this one sinless question: “Is such cruelty truly necessary?” </p>
<p>“No!” He had judged; his modern sensibilities would not allow it! In a world where he could cultivate to be anything, he chose to be kind. Thus, standing upon the shoulders of all the great thinkers of Earth, with his rich foxy sweetheart as his compass, he had set out with a dream to make the heavens merciful.</p>
<p>But alas, lady fate was fickle after all.</p>
<p>In a twist of celestial irony, Yung’s compassionate bid to better the world turned the very heavens into a divine comedy even the tribulations found too absurd to strike down.</p>
<p>On Yung’s cosmic stage, the Ancestral Sages misplaced their wisdom, while the Sect Sovereigns played the fools. The Empress Fairies waged wars on wonders; as the Bewitching Vixens taunted, dancing in liquid laughter pools. Mortals scorned with contempt a many, for the Enlightened Arhats turned Zen into Zany. Even the Immortal Devils stopped caring, gambling cards with strange Outer Deities. </p>
<p>Like clowns in a circus, the majesties of the multiverse rose below their egos, all wanting to bend Yung’s noble designs for their own uncanny gains.</p>
<p>Join Yung on this bizarre odyssey, as he strives to realize his dreams amidst fate’s unpredictable twists and turns.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Vincent Cordell, a college student with schizophrenia, doesn’t want to be different. He just wants to lead a normal life, something his condition has never let him have. Voices whisper, walls bleed, eyes sprout in strange places. Getting a degree in electrical engineering is hard enough without worrying about falling into the abyss of his own madness.</p>
<p>But one dark night, the abyss pulls him in... </p>
<p>A supernatural entity strikes, and a simple car accident becomes anything but as Vincent finds himself thrust into a majestic, alien world where dragons stand on two legs, living and dying like men. And, thanks to a painful, impossible transformation, he is now one of them, stuck in a body he doesn't even know how to use.</p>
<p>An ancient evil stirs. Strange storms leave terrors in their wake. The natives of this world think Vincent has the power to save them. But he doesn't want anything to do with them or their myths. Dragons and prophecies are the products of a broken mind...aren't they? </p>
<p>---</p>
<p>If I were to describe A Chronicle of Lies in a single sentence, I would describe it as ""Thomas Covenant meets The Dark Crystal and Neverending Story"".</p>
<p>I grew up with those films, fell in love with those worlds. They both terrified and enchanted me. I want to recreate these feelings in the reader. I want you to be enraptured one moment... and I want to scare the crap out of you the very next. </p>
<p>I'm also a fan of Stephen R. Donaldson's Magnum opus. Though the idea of somebody with schizophrenia being transported to a fantasy realm was one I had for years, The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant has a tangible influence on my work. </p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>What to expect: </strong></p>
<p>*A world rich with detail and flowing descriptions. I love immersing myself in fantastical settings and I want my readers to feel what I feel.</p>
<p>*Characters that feel real, that live and breathe on each page.</p>
<p>*A grandiose epic. (even if it takes a while to take off.)</p>
<p>*A troubled, sometimes difficult protagonist who finds himself transported to a majestic, beautiful world, and he doesn't know how to react to it. He is distrustful of its beauty. </p>
<p>*I go for a somewhat authentic portrayal of schizophrenia (hopefully). Because of this, the narrative is at times, fragmented and dreamlike in the beginning. Vincent's thoughts can be incoherent and so, the prose can be surreal to match. This is a stylistic choice in order to give gravity to a plot development that occurs in chapter 12. </p>
<p></p>
<p>""Movie"" rating: R-restricted. While I strive to enchant people, this can be a dark, eerie work at times. There is graphic violence, profanity, and it tackles heavy themes such as mental illness and trauma. </p>

<p>Players will have their DNA tested which will allow accurate placement within the old world, in the same general area as their ancestors would have been. Allowing them to chose their starting area from the many races that make up their ancestry. from there they will undergo the Trials, a series of events serving as their entry into adulthood which will start the players off at the age of Thirteen, with every trial completed they will be advanced in age until they are Eighteen, from there they will have the option of staying Eighteen or advancing to their physical age.</p>
<p>From there the world is open for them to go where they please, be it becoming a blacksmith, a cook, or a lord, though they will have to earn everything through the proper ways, hard work, and dedication to their roles.

<p>This story could be about the Tellask Empire, ruler of a thousand suns and faced with imminent peril at the hands of the Orakh hordes.  It could be about Paltai Amberell, the scion of a noble elven House, fallen upon hard times and seeking to find the key that will restore his family's name and save the Empire itself.  It could be the story of his voidship, The Viceroy's Pride, powered by magic and crewed by a team of crack marines as they search for adventure and the solution to the Empire's myriad problems.</p>
<p>Instead, this is the story of Daniel Thrush, human electrical engineer, befuddled researcher and survivor of the debacle that was first contact with a spacefaring civilization. Due to a combination of luck, magic, hard work, and more luck he is thrust into the center of events as Earth is shoved onto a much larger stage rife with semi-immortal elves and magical kingdoms that predate the Earthly invention of agriculture.</p>
<p>Earth is outnumbered, and we have precisely one wizard.  Dan.  He's not very good at it, but he's going to have to learn in a hurry or watch everything he knows get torn apart by massive spacefaring empires straight from the pages of a fantasy novel.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Some readers have noted that the MC tends to be weak willed and pushed around a bit.  A significant portion of the story is his character growth into not being a pushover (i.e. him being passive is in the early chapters on purpose).  I'm just including this caveat/warning to make sure that readers aren't surprised/upset and that they stick with it until he learns to stand up for himself.</p>
<p>His arc begins to crystallize around chapters 25-27.  If that's too long to wait, I get it, I'm just trying to do my due diligence and warn you that the character development is a bit of a slow burn.</p>

<p>Silas--a scavenger living off the ruins of humanity--has spent his entire life fighting tooth and nail to provide for himself and his crew.</p>
<p>But when a scavenging run goes awry and he's snatched up by an android patrol, he finds himself thrown into a cage and priced to sell as a pet.</p>
<p>And when a suitor comes calling, he fears the worst: that he'll be turned into a Domestic, a human lapdog brainwashed into total obedience.</p>
<p>Instead, he discovers an equally disturbing truth: that the creatures who stole his world have created a videogame the likes of which Earth has never seen; a sprawling, game-like theme park where humans are the Avatars and androids are the players who control them.</p>
<p>And to make matters worse, his android guide is as hopeless as they come, having gotten all of her previous Avatars killed in record time.</p>
<p>So if Silas wants to regain his freedom, he'll not only have to fight his way through a world that was specifically designed to murder him in brutal fashion--he'll also have to convince his android guide that he should be the one calling the shots.</p>
<p>FAQS:</p>
<p>Q: Who are you, handsome stranger?</p>
<p>A: I'm Kyle Kirrin, the author of Shadeslinger, book 1 of The Ripple System, published by Portal Books, and I write crunchy LitRPG.</p>
<p>Q: What is Wildling? And is it complete?</p>
<p>A: Wildling is a crunchy LitRPG mash up of Fantasy and Science Fiction. And yup, Wildling is already complete at 64 chapters, or about 120,000 thousand words. You're looking at something like a third draft here--it's fairly polished, but it hasn't been picked over by a copy editor yet nor has my developmental editor seen it.</p>
<p>Q: Upload schedule?</p>
<p>A: 5 initial chapters today (2/15/2021) and one chapter a day for the next month. After that I'll probably slow down to 2 or 3 chapters a week until the story is complete.</p>
<p>Q: How crunchy is it?</p>
<p>A: It's pretty crunchy. I'd put it on the same tier as Ascend/The Land/RSSG, but it might be a bit crunchier than those three?</p>
<p>Q: Is this the first book in a series or a web novel or what? And what are your plans for it?</p>
<p>A: It's currently a standalone with series potential. Full disclosure: this story may head the way of my publisher eventually, but will be available on RR for quite a while no matter what. Likely several months after it's complete with plenty of warning before/if it's taken down.</p>
<p>Q: What kind of build does the MC create?</p>
<p>A: Sword and board!</p>
<p>Q: Crafting?</p>
<p>A: Plenty! Crafting isn't as center stage as it is in The Way of the Shaman, but it's close.</p>
<p>Q: Base building?</p>
<p>A: Two fully separate, distinct bases, both of which play a major role in the story.</p>
<p>Q: VRMMO? Portal? Reincarnation or what?</p>
<p>A: This one's a bit tricky. Basically an advanced race has created a game-like world that closely resembles a theme park. Think Westworld but with copious amounts of loot. And the MC has to fight his way through that to earn his freedom.</p>
<p>Q: Permadeath?</p>
<p>A: Nope! The MC gets 3 lives to play through the entirety of the game world, and death is extremely punishing, but not fatal.</p>
<p>Q: Harem? Or romance?</p>
<p>A: No and no.</p>
<p>Q: Cursing? Blood?</p>
<p>A: Quite a bit of cursing, yeah. There's blood, too, but it's not a gory book by any means.</p>
<p>Q: How can I support?</p>
<p>A: Instead of a Patreon/donations etc, I'd ask that you consider giving my debut LitRPG Shadeslinger a chance. It's free on Kindle Unlimited and the audio is already out narrated by Travis Baldree. It's an epic fantasy VRMMO where the main character gets 3 days of exclusive access to a new game plus a snarky, talking axe to guide him through it in exchange for agreeing to become the target of a serverwide manhunt once the Head Start period ends.</p>
<p>Q: How's it similar to Wildling? And how's it different?</p>
<p>A. The crunch level is very similar, but Shadeslinger is a much lighter, epic fantasy take on the genre. It's also VRMMO, but without any real world components aside from the first chapter. The MC is very different--he comes off as a bit of a jerk early on and can take a bit to warm up to, especially before his backstory is revealed--but he's also got a talking axe that constantly puts him in his place. Shadeslinger's a much more humorous story in general, and it's a great deal more polished as well.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! I hope you enjoy Wildling!</p>

<p>In the streets of New London, year 2493, Nicolai is a centuries-old killer whose brain was implanted into the body of Zero-Twelve, a militarized killbot. He spends his days mostly numb and apathetic, a cog in a machine.</p>
<p>But when Heaven arrives, and the Great Game with it, Nicolai is reborn as a human, his old body recreated—along with the madness and blood rage that characterised his past. To orient himself in this new world he is only given one direction: <em>find the Lizard</em>.</p>
<p>Watch Nicolai try to survive when thrown into Nightmare, a world of Cultivation, Undead, Demons, Spirit Beasts, Sects and Clans, and much, much more. He finds himself in a rambling castle constructed long ago by the mysterious People. Now it is a decaying ruin, filled with undead who lack a purpose. But there is a war raging in this castle, one that started long ago and which is now entering its final stages, with no care for the human arrivals. In the midst of this he seeks to remain in control of himself, struggling against the dark urges which are ever eager to erupt from him.</p>
<p>For Nicolai, in spite of all difficulties, this new world is a dream come true. After a century trapped within Zero-Twelve, he is free. Now, he can resume his endless goal.</p>
<p><strong>To become the greatest fighter alive.</strong></p>

<p><span>Satan's Axe...Lord of High Honor...The Immortal Giant...The Black Maelstrom...Son of Thunderfield...The Gods' Retribution. </span></p>
<p><span>Dalric had many names. None were as fitting as his last, Dalric the Deathseeker. Born from an unwanted mating between the greatest warriors of the time, death was his only true kin. It birthed him, molded him, and now standing in the middle of a lifeless battlefield, it drenched him. The blood of thousands of soldiers soaked his skin. Two hundred thousand men approached him that day. All of them sought his life, none of them left with theirs. But they would not die in vain, they had accomplished their mission. Hidden beneath a thousand layers of their blood, was Dalric's very own. </span></p>
<p><span>Feeling his life fade, he gazed weakly at his work. A seemingly endless array of corpses laid battered and disfigured before him. Some bore faces of horror, most had no face at all. </span></p>
<p><span>His most trusted companion floated in front of him, blocking the view. Waves of sorrow flowed between them. </span></p>
<p><span>“My time has finally come. I’ve begged for death and it’s finally arrived. My work is done...and so is yours. You’re free to be who you were meant to.”</span></p>
<p><span>With his contract with the gods fulfilled, they were truly free. The centuries of torment would end. No longer would they have to walk the path of a monster.  </span></p>
<p><span>Little did Dalric know, the devil was in the details.</span></p>

<p>Along the way he will meet fantastical races, fight alongside Dragons, and come to understand the true meaning of Heroism—and all the sacrifice that comes with it.</p>

Longing for his former life of peace and understanding, he allows authorities to capture him on the spot, only to be faced with deeply personal questions, such as ""who are you?""

<p>This is a litrpg story complete with levels, classes, stats, gear, spells and skills, and some limited quests. The stats mean something for the development of the character but full stat sheets are only repeated in their own chapters after there have been changes. You could enjoy the story without the stats but I believe they add to it. </p>
<p>There is some romance which will be handled slowly. This occurs between multiple characters but is NOT harem in any way, nor will it be poly. There will simply be more than one couple in the story, each working through romances in their own way.</p>
<p>I included the gore tag because there is some significant violence but I don't believe it is particularly bloody.  The story is told from the first person perspective of Nico, but there are <br/>a number of interludes which tell the story from Cami's perspective but in 3rd person. She could be considered the second main character.</p>
<p>My goal is to post several chapters in rapid succession and then a chapter every day M-F.</p>
<p>The chapters will vary in length between 1800-4000 words as the story dictates. Most will be between 2000-2500 words. The prologue is shorter. </p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Charles Monroe survived the disappearance of his parents, did his best to hold things together for himself and his sister. He survived when she, too, vanished, leaving behind nothing but a cryptic note. He was devastated, but he kept moving forward as best he could. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Cancer didn’t put him down, and after suffering through several rounds of chemotherapy, Charles Monroe thought that things might finally be looking up.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Now, on the bridge between life and death, he hears a voice claiming to know where his family went.

With no other option but the dark oblivion of death, Charles chooses to make a deal with the spirit of a distant world that's seeking a wild card in its battle against the gods, monsters, and mortals that threaten its existence. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400"">Someday, he’ll find where his family went. Someday, he’ll uphold his end of the bargain and hunt beings powerful beyond anything he’s ever known. Someday, he might even – hatch?</span></p>

<p>Things to Know:</p>
<p><em>-Cheep!? Will release on a minimum weekly schedule. </em></p>
<p><em>-After a backlog of chapters, posting will slow, but in the interim you can expect a chapter a day up until roughly 25 chapters.</em></p>
<p><em>-This story at times will potentially carry some heavy moments, but the tone is intended to be lighter overall. </em></p>
<p><em>-There are invisible game-like elements in this story, but nothing so concrete as a dedicated gamelit novel.</em></p>
<p><em>-I personally have some issues with anxiety, so I may or may not interact with the community a lot. I'll try if anyone has questions, but I can't guarantee that it'll be consistent.</em></p>
<p><em>-MC is a non-human lead, and will never actually become human. Romance will potentially happen between side-characters, but not with the MC. </em></p>
<p><em>-MC IS NOT THE ONLY VIEW POINT. I have to put that out there because people sometimes hate alternate PoV's in a story. None of them will be filler, and they'll be there only to give a little bit more nuance and meaning to the world that the MC has stepped in, or is about to be imminently important. I'll try to keep them down, but this also helps to prevent me from burning out getting trapped in one view.</em></p>
<p><em>-Most of all, I hope that this story is enjoyable to you, and that you have a great time reading it!</em></p>

<p>This is a fantasy novel with a gender-bending body-swapping protagonist. There will be NSFW chapters because it is a gender bender. Those will be marked and I will make it so readers that don't want to read them can skip them. Some other chapters might have a little bit here and there but will be both light and brief.</p>

<p>--AUTHOR NOTE, PLEASE READ--</p>
<p>I will state here my promises to you, potential reader:</p>
<p>1. No harem! I don't trust myself to make a harem feel natural or healthy, I never met any person who has a personality that can adapt and live in a harem for reasons that are not monetary, so I can't draw inspiration from real life. Sorry!;</p>
<p>2. The enemies will not be bland and illogically mean. Some may feel like that at first, but I will take great care in fleshing them out, trust me. You may end up hating some, but you won't be able to deny that they had their reasons for what they did;</p>
<p>3. I am using a paid (and expensive) automated editor tool, and I take longer to write because I take my time in editing the stuff. I am aiming to improve and I will not shy away from constructive criticism, nor take offense for no reason;</p>
<p>4. Characters will die and will suffer, some will get over the tragedies and improve, others will not be as resilient.</p>
<p>5. This novel has a lot of ground to cover, it is neither a short story, a manual on crafting, or the script of some action scene. There will be both time skips and oversimplifications of some actions for the sake of moving the story forward. Time skips will be more prominent in the first 30 chapters. I will describe crafting processes and fights with more detail if they are essential for the chapter;</p>
<p>6. If I took my time describing something, it's because it is important. I hate novels that waste time describing useless stuff. If you skim over something, the chances are that something in the future will not make sense. I am an adept of ""Chekhov's gun"" principle;</p>
<p>7. I already have 31k words on my auxiliary documents, I have a plan for the story, and I will not be making changes even if someone ends up noticing some foreshadowing and figures out what will happen. The story comes first.</p>
<p>8. I have a wife, a job that demands 9h every day and courses related to my job (lawyer) three days of the week, it's unlikely that I will be able to do mass releases at all. I will have a healthy amount of chapters to be able to post at least 1 chapter every day continually. Don't worry.</p>
<p>9. I will read all the comments. I will listen to all you have to say and will try my best to accommodate demands as long as they do not hamper the path I prepared.</p>
<p>10. There is an arc that spans the entire novel. Each volume will be an arc in itself while progressing a little bit of the main arc. Every arc will have one or more main antagonists.</p>
<p><br/>I think that's it! Thank you for reading it all. Have an awesome time reading my first novel!! &lt;3</p>",4.4,LitRPG;Reincarnation;Psychological;Male Lead;Strong Lead;Adventure;Fantasy;Magic;GameLit;High Fantasy

<p><strong>When reality breaks, sometimes you need a scientist to put it back together.</strong></p>
<p>Vern thought he understood the universe. Then Objectivity shattered, and with it, every law the world held dear.</p>
<p>Now, this ordinary scientist—overlooked by time itself, must become something more. Armed with his analytical mind, a dangerous rune of an Old God etched in his psyche, and a unique perspective of <strong>Balance</strong>, Vern plunges into the abyss of Observation.</p>
<p>But as he delves deeper into the gothic streets of Elmhurst, he uncovers terrifying truths—horrors beyond human comprehension stalking the city, ancient societies vying for control over existence itself, cults preaching for old gods, and things better left unsaid. Each revelation tests the limits of his sanity, and to survive, Vern must ascend, pushing the boundaries of what it means to be human.</p>

He spends his days being bullied in school, and at home he simply reads and plays games. The only thing he has to look forward to is immersion. When he is immersed in the virtual world he can be whatever, whoever, he wants: He can escape the world that has thrown him away.</p>
<p>As such, when a new game, Dungeon Core Online, comes out, James is excited to play. He immerses himself as soon as he can, but when he is set to create his character he is instead offered a different choice. Now, James is the Dungeon Core and he suddenly finds himself wielding more power, with more options, than he's ever had before. The only downside... there are people in the real world who do anything, even kill, to gain the power of a Dungeon Core in the virtual world.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Arthur didn't like being crown prince very much. It meant he couldn't become what he had always wanted to be, a knight. It also required him to sit in long lessons where people talked about useless magic and boring math.</p>
<p>His life changed the day he awakened.</p>
<p>His father needed him; his <em>country</em> needed him. They were at war, and he would be the key to bring them victory. He only needed to learn how to do that.</p>
<p>Being trained as a squire, he learned, was <em>not</em> what he thought it would be. It took focus, drive, and facing his shortcomings. It also required dealing with embarrassing conversations.</p>
<p>By the end, he learned well. He grew. He became a better person.</p>
<p>Yet, his training wasn't over yet. That had been only the start. One didn't win a war at level 1, much less with mere peak natural stats. Having no skills also didn't inspire much confidence.</p>
<p>So, Arthur was thrown into a dungeon with three other people. His goal: not leave until he reached level 100. Fortunately, time ran over a hundred times faster inside. To those outside, he would come out in no time and bring a glorious end to the war.</p>
<p>Nine years later, he accomplished the goal set for him—even became a mage, of all things!—and learned he had been lied to.</p>
<p>There was no war waiting for him outside. No kingdom either. No parents, familiar faces, or even the society he knew. Time actually ran over a hundred times <em>slower</em> in the dungeon.</p>
<p>Arthur found himself lost in a very strange future.</p>
<p>The world's mana levels were low, and mana-effective magitech replaced awakeners and magic. Dungeons were few and far between. The Fated Races were splintered just like before the Great War from fifteen hundred years ago. And prophecy foretold of a shadow to come.</p>
<p>Now, he had to navigate an unknown world in search of his place and purpose in life—all the while surviving conspiracies from old enemies and allies alike.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Warnings:</strong> </p>
<p>- A lot more show than tell (usually), which affects the pacing</p>
<p>- So, slow-paced</p>
<p>- Character-driven</p>
<p>- 3D characters who make mistakes, too</p>
<p>- The main character takes 9 chapters to enter the dungeon, then another 17 to leave it (chapter 26)</p>
<p>- The main character will be overpowered when he leaves. Not invulnerable or unkillable but close enough, at least for a while</p>
<p>- I'll try to balance character growth, mystery unveiling, learning about a new world (sense of adventure), overall plot, and action—but I might fail</p>

Not a full-on x-over, with only some elements of the Gamer genre. OC/Quasi-SI.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 1</strong>: The story starts almost 4000 years before the Prequels but arrives in that era by the end of the Prologue.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 2</strong>: I first published the story on Fanfiction.net 5 years ago. When I started, I felt a semi-strong GAMER/RPG style would work in a Star Wars setting, thus the early chapters have a lot of typical GAMER/RPG jargon/styling. However, after the first main arc, I started to see the flaw and the system is slowly pulled back from being a major driving force for the story. It is still there, five years and ~800k words later, but the OC drives the story, not the system.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 3</strong>: I am well aware there are several issues of various quality with book one (especially the first few chapters and arcs) and while rewriting them was considered if I did that, then I'd all but start from scratch and I feel that would be a waste of the 5 years and (as of this time) 800k+ words I've written.

<p></p>
<p>What can you expect from Sanctuary?</p>
<p>- The main protagonist starts out like a normal person, and although his journey will take him to the pinnacle of power, he will not always be the strongest person around. Typical weak-to-strong.<br/>A central theme in the beginning is for Matt to find his Way (capital W intended!) in a world where he sees his friends gaining new and fantastical powers, but all he has is a weird pulsating sphere of power in his mind. The main concept that I want to explore more than anything else is how personal choices affect both the person making them, and the world around them.</p>
<p>- Both the main protagonist and the people around him will experience not just progression growth, but emotional growth<br/>- The story mixes LitRPG progression with Cultivation progression. There is a reason behind, explained in the lore of the world, which will take some time to explore<br/>- There are some numbers, but these will fade more into the background as the story goes on. Overall the pace is on the slower side.<br/>- There are some pretty strong city building elements that will come to the fore in certain parts of the story, but they will also fade in and out<br/>- More than a ""Numbers Go Up"" story, Sanctuary is about exploration and uncovering ancient mysteries that dictate present life<br/>- It can get dark. But even as the world can get pretty dark, we will travel with people who will make it lighter</p>

As a symbol of their cooperation, they have worked together to establish the Grand Academy of Spiritual, Martial, and Arcane Arts, a place where the best and brightest of each nation can gather on neutral ground and share knowledge, techniques, and cultures.

<p>Dungeons. </p>
<p>Everyone's heard of them. Sprawling maze-like places where you can find special objects that can't be found anywhere else in the world, train to become a great warrior or wizard, and slay dozens of monsters. Drops! Loot! Glory! What more could you want? Dungeons are places of danger and adventure, full of thrills and maybe even romance, where people enter as your normal and everyday person but leave as a hero.</p>
<p>Even a child knows what a dungeon is!</p>
<p>A dungeon is controlled and ruled over by its Dungeon Core, a mana crystal that's gained sentience, and with it a mind just as twisted as the home that it makes for itself. Dungeon Cores all have very simple wants and needs: to expand and to devour, and to that end, they'll do absolutely everything and anything within their power.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though? Sometimes <em>the Dungeon Core</em> doesn't know that.</p>
<p>Sometimes they wake up all alone, confused and with no clue what they should do, and find themselves quickly becoming the home to a family of badgers and other creatures. The Dungeon Core can be left struggling to figure out their role in the world and how exactly they're supposed to achieve it.</p>
<p>They're really doing their best, and you shouldn't judge them for it! The badger thing was a complete mistake but there's just <em>no way they can turn back and fix it so they're just trying to make do, okay?! </em>What would you do in their situation?!</p>

He was a guy with dreams of making it big someday in the future but having no real plan as to how he was going to achieve it. But Leon did have one thing going for him. He’d found a niche on the internet making videos that had gotten him quite a big following in the past year or so.

<p>Jack believes he's meant to do something more with his life, but he just can't seem to catch his lucky break. That's when he finds out about the MMORPG: New Earth. When he hears that some lucky players are making a living playing a game, he's confident he has found his ticket to wealth. Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. It seems like craftsmen, especially, make easy money in the game. What better way to win back his girlfriend and prove to his father that he is awesome than entering the game and becoming a millionaire? It almost sounds too good to be true.</p>
<p>Maybe it is. Maybe this MMORPG will put Jack to work like never before. And maybe, just maybe, he'll go from being an immature brat to becoming a hardworking man.</p>

<p>-------<br/>Hello, there. I'd written this novel a while back and only recently picked it up again, and decided to post it.<br/>I write mostly for fun, so uh... I can guarantee no update consistency. I will try to post 3 to 4 chapters a week, but again, I can't guarantee anything.</p>
<p>A/N 1: This is a Gender Bender work. If you dislike that, this is not for you; just don't give it a bad rating/review for that. However, Gender Bender does not have much relevance to the story. This was an idea I had a long time ago when I'd read the first Transmigrated-into-a-Villain/Young Master story. That's when I wondered what if it was written from the perspective of the Jade Beauty instead? So, I came up with the idea of some guy transmigration into the body of one. But at the time, I despised the 'conflict' that came with the category, so I kinda skipped the entire thing. So don't expect gender identity issues from this story - even if there are, it will be resolved in a few chapters at most. This is primarily a Progression Fantasy/Power Fantasy from a Jade Beauty's perspective.<br/>Though, you can also think of it as an amateur author's way of escaping his responsibilities and not studying the female psyche deeply. Like I said - I write for fun.</p>
<p>A/N 2: I don't have much writing experience and I do want to improve, so your critiques are welcome. Just don't be too harsh - my glass heart might just break.</p>
<p>A/N 3: MC will be extremely strong in her Cultivation Stage - and the strongest later on, but that doesn't mean much in the Cultivation World, where there is always a 'Heaven beyond the Heavens'.</p>
<p>A/N 4: This is still a WIP. I have the general plot idea in mind, but nothing concrete. Plus, I haven't made the mechanics of this world as concrete as I would like. So, I might make minor changes here and there. If I do make such changes, I'll do it retroactively across all relevant chapters. So, early readers might get a little confused, and I apologise for that.<br/>Of course, I'll post a note when I do make changes.</p>
<p>A/N 5: This story will take a while to pick up. So don't expect MC to have tremendous odds stacked against her from the very beginning. In fact, this will be more slice-of-life at the beginning.</p>
<p>A/N 6: Although, I've tagged this story as a Comedy, my kinda humour might not appeal to you</p>",4.39,LitRPG;Reincarnation;Xianxia;Comedy;Female Lead;Action;Fantasy;Romance;Martial Arts;Gender Bender;Strong Lead;High Fantasy;Attractive Lead

<p>However, how could any of the short-lived races, Chosen and Monster alike, know that the tiny, weak, lizard-like creature was much more than it seemed. That it was an entity only spoken of in myth and legend. From a species that their ancestors, with the backing of the Gods, paid a huge price to remove. A heretical existence that threatened the fragile peace that had descended upon their world.</p>

<p>Warning! Emotions below!</p>
<p>My friend and I shared a lot of love for pokémon. Its how we connected. After she chose to transition from he to she we fell apart. Mostly because of my projections and ignorance. Of not letting myself see who she was the whole while.</p>
<p>When she died I started dreaming of this story. And I wished she never had to go through all the things that made her life difficult. Plus I totally couldn't even begin to think of how to describe what she went through. So this is a wish for her someplace having a good, exciting life like the MC will. If someone is offended by the ease of her rebirth then I am sorry. It is a sincere wish that somewhere my friend didn't have to deal with the awfulness she went through. And I apologize because it won't change.</p>
<p>I am not a writer. I started this to deal with my emotions and guilt. </p>
<p>And it became something I loved. Enjoy or not as you like. I wish you a fantastic day regardless.</p>

<p>No, he is not a wizard. Wizardry is perfectly natural, after all, some of it quite commonplace - necromancy has such practical industrial applications, though the old Duke of York wasn't a particularly big fan of the necroindustrial revolution that has swept the empire ruling the isle of Great Britain. York itself is a somewhat backwards duchy, abundant in land and people, but its economic development was severely delayed by the old Silver Duke, who had little tolerance for wizards and little interest in issuing peasant-hunting licenses to promote regular harvests of the duchy’s human resources.</p>
<p>Will Avery betray his ancestor's memory? Can an underdeveloped York stand its ground against its neighbors? And, as a single man in possession of a good fortune, will he marry? These are all matters of grave political importance that could shake the foundations of life in the largest duchy of England at a time when the empire itself is in a delicate state.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom dictates that Avery should turn to conventional wizardry to solve his duchy's problems and conventional marriage to solve his political problems.</p>

<p>The boy was done with human society and so had run away into the woods back on Earth. But when the moon shattered and unleashed the entity called the System, the world changed. Some refused to accept their new life, while others thrived in this new game like reality. But for Aenon, this was an opportunity of a lifetime. An opportunity to seek his most desperate desire - True freedom. He didn't wish to rely on anyone and wanted no one to rely on him. But when ancient powers seek to control his life, and new allies wish nothing but the best for him, can he truly pursue solitude? Follow Aenon's journey as he rises in power with the sole purpose of being left alone.</p>
<p>What to expect:</p>
<p>- A strong MC who doesn't tolerate being wronged, but also retaliates proportionally. Might seem a bit dark at times, but it is so for a reason.</p>
<p>- A strong to stronger progression with emphasis on character building.</p>
<p>- Story focused writing style, with LitRPG elements used to add flavor. Don't expect to be inundated in System notifications and detailed stat sheets in every chapter. They are there, but spread out to let you focus on the overall story.</p>
<p>- First few chapters (about 4 or 5) have multiple POVs. Although I have an MC, I like to show other people's perspective at times. The number of POVs fall drastically after chapter 5. The story is focused on the MC.</p>

<p>Please accept this letter as my formal resignation from being a Player.</p>
<p>Hey! Laugh all you want, but I had to try. With no rules down here, who's to say that I can't resign?</p>
<p>Anyway, my reasons are simple: I'm neither a gamer nor a hero. You got the wrong person for the job. Sure, the pay is decent and I could pretty much live like a king if, you know, I wasn't so busy <em>trying to survive</em>. I have major concerns about the demonic dagger bound to my soul too. Come to think of it, I've never asked to be transported to this fantasy land either and would like you to return me home, thank you very much. I don't want supernatural powers, I don't want to complete quests after quests, and I don't want to be your test subject anymore. What? I'm not whining, you're whining. Stop making excuses and let me leave already.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding, and I hope you'll find a better replacement after I'm gone for good.</p>

<p>--&gt; Some GameLit elements are presented subversively. If you want the protagonist to “play the game” properly, this might not be the story for you.<br/>--&gt; No filler chapters; the story's structure is already plotted out. It's going to have six story arcs.<br/>--&gt; Character development happens slowly, over many chapters. Don't expect a perfect protagonist right off the bat.<br/>--&gt; Some romance, but it will never be the main focus.<br/>--&gt; Humor and dark elements in equal measure, but not to the extent that I’d label this story as “Comedy” or “Grimdark”.</p>

<p>The trial, the tutorial, or whatever you wanted to name it, was over. After forty long solitary years spent mastering the system, Tom, with his abilities reset was going to have to do it all again to save humanity.</p>
<p>The cost of failure would have an unimaginable impact on his friends and family. His sacrifices had propelled him into the top million, giving him the opportunity to make a difference. And he had a risky plan to do so.</p>
<p>Against their will, humanity had been chosen, and all Tom could do was to work with the system.</p>
<p>Universe spanning gods ran a regular competition on a world called Existentia where they pitted seven species from different universes all of whom have dominated their home planet against each other.</p>
<p>But a straight-out fight would be too simple. Existentia is a living, breathing, impossibly large, magical world with existing empires, secrets, dungeons and trials. The seven races in the current iteration of the competition have their own unique advantages to exploit, but first they have to survive long enough to show their worth.</p>

<p>Jack had always wanted to be a Shaper, to form pure life-force into obedient beasts and monsters and lead them into battle. Unfortunately, the only way to Shape life-force is through the use of Patterns, and the knowledge of how to make Patterns was lost when the old-world fell. These days, what Patterns remain in the world are closely guarded by their owners, who charge exorbitant amounts of gold from anyone who wants to use them.</p>

<p>            Every 10 years, on Drop Night, the gods grant cards to a lucky few. Whoever becomes a deckbearer has access to monsters, magic, enchanted buildings, and even companions.</p>
<p>            Everyone wants to be lucky.</p>
<p>            Wolfe is the top enforcer of the Grimm Family Mafia, and he’s never been particularly lucky. But on Drop Night, he receives a deck of cards from the Infernal gods—a deck that, oddly, specializes in hunting other Infernal decks.</p>
<p>            As if that wasn’t enough, one of Wolfe’s cards claims he will receive incredible power if he can find the five other cards in the <em>Gates of the Underworld </em>set.</p>
<p>            But bad luck follows Wolfe like a shadow. It turns out, members of the Grimm Crime Family have at least one of the other cards in the <em>Gates of the Underworld</em>.</p>

<p><strong>What to Expect:</strong> A young, immature MC who is selfish and self-centered and has been sheltered from the consequences of this behavior, exploring a world where the inhabitants see and treat him like the child he still is on the inside. This is a coming-of-age story and his growth will not be immediate. This MC will spend a lot of time being UNDERPOWERED. You are not supposed to like where he starts, but want to see him grow. The worldbuilding is rich, the plot development so subtle you are actually intended to miss some of the carefully-laid hints until later reveals. If you think you see this story heading in a very predictable direction with very obvious hints, don't be so sure. Wait, and I think most of the time you will be pleasantly surprised.

<p>Ever since meeting his uncle, Arthur has pushed himself daily to achieve an arbitrary goal. He trained like nobody else did, longer than anybody else could. He neglected his personal relationships to pursue something he didn't even understand, in hindsight. When the time came for his class awakening ritual, he was ready. He was ready to receive a powerful starting class and to break free from his boring lifestyle.</p>
<p>Well, you know what they say, ""Be careful what you wish for, lest your wish be granted.""</p>
<p>Arthur was assigned the death knight class, which is just<em> barely, technically, maybe</em> legal.</p>
<p>With it, he learns about what drove him to such simple minded ambition in the first place: his affinity. Now, he's faced with a dilemma: will he embrace it, or reject it?</p>

(So I made a grand colosseum for the greatest champions of humanity to fight to the death in)]</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><br/>Being taken from another world, the soul named Munera finds itself reborn as the beating heart of a wild dungeon – an entity known as a Dungeon-Core. With nothing to do but watch humans fight against one another and against itself, confused about its new purpose in this other world and ‘body’ – that is actually a complicated network of underground tunnels and chambers rather than a simple construct of flesh and bone – Munera comes to the obvious conclusion that life is about nothing else other than gratuitous violence and the assertion of dominance over lesser beings!</p>
<p>Taking this to the next level, it sets out to find out everything about fighting, combat, and the ascension to power and purpose through raw strength, cunning tactics, and sly strategy by creating a grand arena, a colosseum. In this newly formed underground labyrinth, the blood-hungry entity imprisons countless humans, monsters, elves, and all manner of beings with the intent to make them fight against one another with sword and magic and in contests of cunning and wit in order to prove the validity of the pursuit of purpose through raw power of many shapes.</p>
<p>Will its confused quest and methods succeed in pressing out the distilled essence of life from the bones of its new gladiators through the filter of challenges and nightmares? Or will it lose control over its prisoners as they band together with one another, its own domain crumbling with this violence turning its way instead? Find out in the latest novel from trending fantasy and isekai author D.M. Rhodes!</p>

<p>What to expect:</p>
<p>A young man's journey full of struggle, pain, determination, and discovery in a land familiar but twisted. This is the first book of a series and, in the beginning, the only person left to navigate the new world is our MC, alone.</p>
<p>Heavy survival and post apocalyptic themes, with a dose of dark fantasy that becomes ever more prominent as the mysteries unfold.  I don't hesitate to use the word gritty.</p>
<p>There are new, improved, blue boxes!  There are literpg elements which are not abused, but have a role in the story.  Now hear this, there will NOT be numbers go burr!!  There are dungeons and classes, and I hope they're done in an interesting manner.</p>
<p>There is magic, but not wizardry, so to speak, and magitech is present, but not prevalent, especially at the beginning.</p>

<p>On New Year's Eve, Lo Fennrick decides that he wants to die. The universe seems to hear him for the first time in his entire life, and just as the clock strikes 00:00, a message pops up inviting him to the Tutorial. Fennrick accepts. But at the prompt to choose the difficulty level, is there anything the former pro gamer can do but pick the very hardest--appropriately titled <em>Hell</em>?</p>
<p>Hell, as the name implies, is nothing less than endless torment, not all too dissimilar to what Fennrick's life already was. Monsters, imprisonment and execution is enough to stretch what little sanity he has left to the brink of snapping, a haze of RED, BLACK and WHITE threatening to submerge him in eternal madness. However, despite his numerous sins and misdeeds, the world isn't quite ready to see him off just yet. Will those he cherishes be able to save him from the mad clutches of his own brain, or will he simply drag them down together with him into his self-made hell?</p>

So, fascinated by the humans and their quick rise to power (after all, setting off a mass extinction is a pretty sizable achievement), <strong>what's a nearly all-powerful, somewhat bored, morally ambiguous, savagely violent, shapeshifting alien entity to do other than assume the form of a human</strong> and do some front-line investigating?</p>

<p><span><strong>ON HIATUS!</strong></span></p>
<p>Hello and thank you for reading! Constructive criticism and grammar-policing are both appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>Parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are complete at 1271 pages! Part 7 is in progress!</strong></p>
<p>If you've ever read any other web serials, you might've noticed that authors get better with time (that is, their art or writing improves). Wutosama of Metaworld Chronicles noted that the first 20 chaps are always a mess.</p>
<p>This is also the case with Apex Predator. The first two parts (ranging just under 30 chapters, or 161 pages) are absolutely subpar. While I have edited them as of 7-10-18, they require a rewrite, which is currently in the works but not complete.</p>

<p>Two animals awaken in the forest, no longer themselves. Struggling to hold on to their human identities despite their new animal bodies, they have to find their place in this strange world of animals with their own civilization, but no humans. <br/><br/>To the natives of this world, these two people are not strangers, but friends and family who have been stricken with a mental affliction, in need of care and a cure. <br/><br/>Do they have a responsibility to those they've harmed through no fault of their own? Do they even have a right to exist, when that existence came at the cost of another? <br/><br/>When they have lost their voice, their home, and even their names, they have to face the possibility that the humans they remember no longer exist. And if so . . . who are they?</p>

<p><b>Things you can expect from this book ↓</b></p>
<p>- Animal Isekai with heavy existential themes</p>
<p>- A detailed and considered society in a world without humans.</p>
<p>- A defined magic/power system geared towards communication and discovery, not combat.</p>
<p>- 3rd Person Limited PoV, multiple main characters</p>
<p>- Compassionate and clever MCs.</p>
<p>- A fleshed out side cast of native animal characters with unique personalities and motivations.</p>
<p>- The cutest pair of squirrel kits you will ever meet.</p>
<p>- Occasional interstitial chapters featuring in-universe writing, always relevant to the current events in the story.</p>
<p>- Emotions running high.</p>
<p>What <span style=""text-decoration: underline""><strong>not</strong></span> to expect:</p>
<p>- Power progression. The setting's magic grows through practiced technique and discovered uses, not statistics or unlocks.</p>
<p>- The characters to regain human form, as much as they wish they could.</p>
<p>- World-ending stakes. The stakes may sometimes be life-or-death, but only for the characters themselves.</p>

Now that they've got the ability to separate a long series into ""volumes"" built into the site, I asked kanadaj to merge them into one. this should be easier for me to manage from a writing standpoint, and also be easier on readers and their follows/bookmarks list. I was informed earlier this week that there were quite a few people who read Skyclad and had no idea Skybound even existed. This should help reduce the chances of that happening in the future, and hopefully surprise any people who still didn't know there was a book 2 but where still subcribed to notifications for Skyclad.</p>

Such needs range from the universal requirement for sustenance, to the more specific, such as the requirement of all higher life to sleep, or even the esoteric, such as the requirement of a pain demon to inflict suffering. The ability to exploit those needs is what separates, to pick a random example, a successful summoner from the shrivelled (but very happy) corpse that had, a few minutes earlier, conjured up a succubus with no plan of how to control her.</p>
<p>The Cruithia Kingdom is well known by its neighbours (or at least, by the subset of them that <i>aren't</i> carbonised silhouettes) for exploiting such needs to bring a shining example of the world's apex predator under their control. For the past hundred years, anyone daring to encroach on the kingdom's territory has found themselves faced, very briefly, by a dragon.</p>
<p>But perhaps 'control' isn't quite the right word, and it's that very dragon that the kingdom's betrayed crown princess is going to need to convince to aid her if she ever wants her position back. A creature of selfishness and pride, evil by any human standard, and yet occasionally steerable by those who know the correct levers.</p>
<p>Not that convincing the dragon to help her take back her kingdom is her primary concern. That accolade goes to the need to convince the dragon not to eat her. Again.</p>

Insatiably curious, he was always on the look out for new or interesting information or things to do.

And if that wasn't enough, the only way to progress and make ends meat is to build and control 'Dungeons' for the righteous humans to invade!<br/><br/>Edwin will have to give it his all in a world he never expected even existed, and will have to learn to survive with his wits and growing power in order to establish something resembling peace in the war-torn lands of Eternia.<br/><br/>-NOTE: I'm still in the process of working on the storyline, characters, and abilities that will be presented.

<p>Second Lieutenant Alexei Vronsky is clinging to his sanity after his comrade was killed in a prolonged siege, but the time for self-loathing and wall punching is over. He finds an intruder in his room, who claims to be a woman—a mythical creature only existed in ancient texts. Against his expectation, she has no wings attached to her back, no laser guns on her shoulders, and not the slightest idea about the endless war between the Republic of Moskva and its vassal states. Suspecting she’s a government experiment, Alexei determines to find answers to the impossible existence of women. However, the deeper he digs into the dark, the further he realizes there’s more to the eternal war than he’s allowed to know.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And the sooner he can stop the cycle of needless deaths the better, before he's shut down. Permanently.</p>

<p>Everyone who is anyone is obsessed with Neon Dragons - the latest highly immersive cyberpunk aRPG from Sparksoft. But as fate would have it, the PC of our late-twenties main character broke, mere days before the game's release.</p>
<p>All she could do was to console herself by watching a copious amount of content creators play through the game she had always dreamt of.</p>
<p>Limiting her own knowledge to the parts of the world she sees in the respective playthroughs, is her way of keeping the mystery surrounding the world alive.</p>
<p>Wiki-dives are her late-night pleasure - naturally only about things that were already covered or appeared in the new episodes of whatever playthrough she was watching.</p>
<p>Things change drastically, however, as one day she wakes up inside the body of a 15-year old girl inside the city of Neo Avalis, 6 years into the game's past.</p>
<p>It feels like a dream come true - she can finally experience the neon-lit streets and mixture of high tech and grime she's only seen in videos!</p>
<p>Plus, Seraphine, as she quickly learns is the name of the body she now inhabits, has an extra thing to be happy about - she can level herself just like a character in the game! </p>
<p>With everything she has read and watched about Neon Dragons, it should be no problem to make herself the perfect person to solve the mystery of the enigmatic Wall at the (seeming) edge of the play-area on her own!</p>
<p>But she quickly realizes that she cannot just sit and grind out her skills while the world is on pause - this game is very real and life in a cyberpunk future is full of danger and intrigue whether you are looking for it or not. </p>
<p>Not only does she need to fit into her new strange family and understand how her abilities work, but also her world seems to have some differences from the game she saw played - differences that are rapidly revealing themselves to be bigger than she had anticipated...</p>

<p>Humanity's solution centered around trying to revive an entity known as the Overseer of All Things, an ancient machine god which was shattered into pieces during the apocalypse. In return for the human's devotion, it gifted them with the tools to fight the monsters which had come to dominate the broken fragments of the world - such as [Classes], [Skills], and most importantly, the ability to [Level Up].</p>
<p>Sláine E. Catháin honestly doesn't give a crap about any of that. A warrior rabbit-girl hailing from a different System, she's decided to come to the human's corner of reality because their methodology has led to them becoming <em>extremely</em> powerful, and even if it's in the foreign land of Arpege, Sláine intends to die a legend. Naturally, she bites off a bit more than she can chew, and when she's paired with a prickly, sarcastic, and mysterious woman named Red, she finds her life soon filled with with drama, mysteries, friendship, love, occasional discussions of how best to hide a body and - ugh - <em>stat optimization.</em> </p>

<p><strong>1 chapter a week every Monday (each minimum 1.5k)</strong></p>
<p>What to expect:</p>
<p>- 2 protagonists, leaning more toward one at the start and with more added later, but only ever one plot thread</p>
<p>- A power set where the main characters are intricately linked with each other, one effectively a warlock while the other her patron even though they are at roughly the same level of power, causing them to rise and fall as a group</p>
<p>- A fast paced story without much extraneous fluff</p>
<p>- Intrigue and manipulation (Describing one of the main characters, one of my readers wrote: <span>I think this might be the first time I see a ""reincarnated"" spy in a webnovel that actually feels like she does intrigue and manipulation, instead of just solving all her problems through brute force</span>)</p>
<p>- Dragon Ball Z level power scaling, with the main characters able to blow up planets by chapter 250</p>
<p>- A very, very slow burn romance</p>
<p>- Common webnovel tropes normally done poorly twisted for the author's amusement to make more sense and work in the story</p>
<p>- Main characters without the best morals</p>
<hr/>
<p>Content Warning:</p>
<p>One lead in the story is suicidal at the start and undergoing a pretty bad breakdown, while the other is possibly even more messed up, only better at hiding it.

<p>The Border Mist materialized abruptly, shrouding the once calm and grey expanse of the sea. The impenetrable veil of white mist lingered persistently, its undulations akin to a living organism, before eventually receding and vanishing, erasing its existence entirely. In the space that had been occupied solely by the sea's surface, an island emerged, boasting a serene town and a grandiose gothic palace that appeared to cast a watchful gaze upon the city.</p>
<p>As the mist traversed the streets, it gradually unveiled the picturesque Victorian-style city. Dim street lamps cast a faint glow upon the cobblestones, revealing numerous statues of varied sizes, shapes, and race. These statues all shared a common trait—they were oriented toward the Gothic palace.</p>
<p>Within the opulent throne room stood a resplendent seat of power. Positioned before the throne were additional statues, all bowing in deference to the statue of the Ruler seated upon it. Draped in a cloak, the Ruler exuded an eerie and oppressive aura, even in statue form. Silence permeated the room; no motion, life, or breath stirred.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the eyes of the Ruler's statue ignited with cerulean flames.</p>
<p>'Ah... what... what's...' Caila pondered as her vision cleared, the memory of darkness faintly lingering.</p>
<p>Surveying the hushed hall, she beheld eerie statues bent in obeisance. 'What happened? Ugh... why... why can't I move?' Caila found herself immobilized; only her eyes retained mobility. She strained her gaze downward, catching a glimpse of her hands resting on the throne's armrests. 'Am I a statue? Wha... what? No! Help! Someone, save me!'

<p>If you wake up in a new world, with only your memories of home to guide you, you have to trust the first people you meet.</p>
<p>The first people Leah meets seem to know her - but not <em>her. </em>Leah is thrust into a fighter's role that does not quite suit her, and those who 'rescued' her do their best to help her fit in. They hint at a world that Leah can only vaguely understand without serious research and exploration, but how to do that research, when everyone believes her to be a local of this place, and too many questions might draw unwanted attention?</p>
<p>And what about home?</p>
<p>The more Leah learns about this world, the less she believes that she woke up on the right side of the bed - or more accurately, on the right side of the conflict. With magic being strictly regulated in her current ""home,"" maybe it's time to uproot and look for a new set of allies...</p>

<p><em>Displacement</em> is a queer / lgbt bodyswap isekai: Leah Armande falls out of a Quebecois city into an unfamiliar fantasy world, and Leah Talesh falls out of her adventuring party's homeland and into an unfamiliar industrial world.

<p>Alex was dying, and all the millions his father had left him meant nothing.</p>
<p>The life he had been so eager to embrace, to do the memory of his father proud, would soon come to an end.</p>
<p>Cancer.</p>
<p>That ugly, terrible word.</p>
<p>He had tried to be strong for his mother, even when the treatments left him violently ill, his body wracked with pain, his friends and even his girlfriend leaving him almost as fast as his once impressive physique wasted  to nothing under the ravages of his illness.</p>
<p>And just when he thought all hope was dead, a couple discrete referals placed by high-powered friends of his family got him an exclusive spot at the most sophisticated cryonic facility in the world.</p>
<p>He didn't know if there was such a thing as an afterlife, but part of the package included uploading a copy of his cortex into a digital universe filled countless worlds to explore, where he could embrace whatever class or profession he could dream of.</p>
<p>All of which sounded hell of a lot better than the miserable death waiting for him in the real world.</p>
<p>In the end, he signed the paperwork, putting his pathetic flickering life in the hands of potential quacks and charlatans.</p>
<p>After all, with death just days away, what did he have to lose?</p>
<p>Even if he could never be successfully revived, he could at least adventure his heart out.</p>

For a fortunate few, the strange world of the Infinite Labyrinth offers opportunities, strange descriptors popping in their minds, informing them of growth, and status beyond that of a mere mortal. The materials and power crystal they bring back foster a new age, both military and civilian. Aether-powered Skyships prowl the skies, as all the great nations blessed by the Gates try to turn the blessings of the Labyrinth into immediate advantages.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400; font-style: normal"">But for Jonas, an apprentice leatherworker, his friend Ira, and so many Londoners, the fabled ones that walk the Labyrinth are distant heroes, seen from afar. They fell short when their Potential was measured, and they fill their mundane lives with distant dreams.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400; font-style: normal"">One man wants to break the stalemate. The Tyrant of the Dominion of France, Napoleon Bonaparte, has a plan. Eighteen years after the world changed, he will force it to change again. And when civilians are caught in the fallout, the unthinkable happens.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400; font-style: normal"">Six people, unqualified, forbidden to ever enter the Labyrinth, find themselves stranded in a distant zone, forcefully turned into Professionals. They know little of what that means, but they have to figure out the rules that are now their lot, for they have little hope to escape their predicament otherwise. They need to understand what the descriptors in their minds mean, what each of the strange piece of gear waiting in treasure chests behind terrible guardians can bring them. They have to become Professionals on their own and rejoin the Empire. They will figure out their new lives one way or another.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400; font-style: normal"">But will there be an Empire waiting for them when the Gates re-open? Caught in a clash of empires and high tiers, they will do what little they can. They will step up and do their best.</p>

<p>The Infinite Labyrinth is a slice-of-life litRPG adventure set in a real historical setting. It's a hard, crunchy litrpg. Expect blue boxes everywhere, and the system itself is very mathy.</p>
<p>It started life as a serial. I prepared some proper worldbuilding, with enough details and background for lots of different potential story arcs, but as I wrote, I realized the main story needs to have a definitive end. So, there are four books in total, for a bit under 1500 pages, plus additional side stories, and even maybe a sequel one day.</p>

<p><em>No one ever knows the whole story. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Deep in the forests of the Pacific Northwest, the fading town of Rallsburg stumbles upon an amazing discovery—magic itself. Faced with potentially world-shattering power, the people of Rallsburg keep the secret for themselves. Led by Rachel DuValle, a perpetually underestimated college student with grand ambitions, they seek to found a new society.</p>
<p>The world beyond suspects nothing, but magic cannot stay hidden forever. A train arrives in Rallsburg carrying Alden Bensen, a directionless high school graduate. To him, magic could represent meaning for his life, an explanation for his empty existence. This potent force offers anyone the power to change humanity forever—or send it cascading into swift and total annihilation.</p>

<p>The Last Science is an ongoing science-fiction / low-fantasy web novel series, focused on the modern world with a twist. New societies bud and grow, but the people who make them up are imperfect and flawed. The story includes elements of mystery, action, crime, interpersonal drama, relationships, philosophy, sociology, politics, and much more, all centered on the perspective characters driving the tale. </p>
<p>This is the ""Scraps Edition"" of the story, where the chapters have been split up into bite-size chunks (roughly 1500-3000 words), for your convenience. The prose has been edited from its original form, with some improvements, but there are no content differences from the original. New chapters will be posted throughout each week starting on Friday and appearing on multiple days thereafter, depending on the length of the chapter. </p>
<p><span><span>Content Warning</span> (by request)</span><span>:</span> This series delves into some topics and situations which may be upsetting for some readers. In American rating parlance, the narrative would be rated PG-13 (except for language), but some have noted the story can get pretty dark on occasion.

Instead, after their abrupt cancellation, a stunning woman with mesmerizing purple eyes and a peculiar accent approached him outside the theater. Little did he know, she was more than she appeared. In an instant, Mitchell was whisked away to another world, narrowly avoiding a deadly fate.</p>
<p>Thrown into a perilous realm with his life hanging by a thread and this enigmatic woman by his side, Mitchell must rapidly master magic, wield a blade, and learn the local language. The stakes couldn't be higher—an entire kingdom's survival depends on him.

Will he rise to the challenge and become the hero this new world so desperately needs? The clock is ticking, and the battle for survival has begun.</p>

<p><strong>Ren is marked by Death.</strong> Everyone on the farm agrees, and they won’t let him forget it. But murderous cultists with a penchant for kidnapping young men are abroad, and the boy the farmers blame for their troubles might be the only one who can help them.</p>
<p><strong>Sara is in danger.</strong> Recently arrived in the ancient city of Uldoroth to enter the service of the Queen, she is beset on all sides by the scheming ambitions of the court. War criminals, murderers, cultists, even her own family; nothing is as it seems, and she must learn to play their game, and play it well, if she is to survive.</p>
<p>Each of them struggle to survive this vast fantasy world, as yet unaware that their stories are bound by a common thread; the abilities, schemes, and bloodlines of the almost mythical Chosen...</p>

Residing within an obscure village in the middle of nowhere, he spends his days farming, hunting, and talking with anyone who happens to pass through, eagerly devouring as many wondrous stories as he can. His most adventurous days involve practicing magic, much to the chagrin of anyone in the vicinity. Poor and unskilled, only in his wildest dreams did he imagine leaving his small village.</p>
<p>While hunting with his childhood friend, they stumble across a band of raiders preparing to attack their village. Desperate to return in time to warn the other villagers, Arkk takes a shortcut through the Cursed Forest where nothing grows and nothing lives. Arkk had no reason to believe otherwise until he stumbles across ruins from an age long past and the monster hailing from the olden days.</p>
<p>A bargain is made. A deal is struck. Arkk didn’t understand the ramifications of his agreement or the enemies it would create. Nevertheless, he has always been one to take advantage of every opportunity. The ruins he found represent the opportunity of a lifetime.</p>

His only wish is to protect his students from the human-insect wars outside the academy, and preferably? He’ll never come in contact with a single bug.</span></p>

The age of Virtual Reality came long ago, opening up new fields for people to enjoy and seek employment. There were even those that chose to sacrifice their physical bodies, becoming digital existences that lived within internet communities. <br/><br/>But with the age of VR, everyone still dreamed of that next step, the next level of adventure. And after a hundred years, it has finally arrived. The first consoles, known as Seeds, mass distributed among the people, with such realism that they no longer qualified as a Virtual Reality, but as an Artificial Reality.

<p>In pursuit of his abusive father’s approval, Zeke Blackwood pushed himself to the very pinnacle of his chosen obsession. Since childhood, all he’d ever wanted to do was play baseball, and through hard work, discipline, and no small degree of talent, his goal of reaching the major leagues was finally in sight. But then a horrific car accident ruined his arm, eliminating any hope of a professional baseball career. </p>
<p>Consumed by depression, Zeke gave up on his future, preferring to wallow in self-pity. That is, until an opportunity came along for him to prove his worth. When his chronically ill younger brother needed a kidney, Zeke didn’t hesitate to offer one of his own—only to die on the operating table.</p>
<p>But eons later, after Earth has been ravaged by disasters both natural and man-made, Zeke is reborn. Guided by the mysterious Oberon, he soon finds himself in the Radiant Isles, a magical land populated by legendary creatures and horrifying monsters alike. A war rages between good and evil, and Zeke—along with the rest of humanity—has been recruited onto the front lines. <br/> <br/>Fully healed from the wounds of his previous life, Zeke battles his way through an army of trolls and other subterranean beings, all the while increasing his skills, improving his strength, and gaining superhuman abilities. Finding allies in Abby, an archer who teaches him about his strange new circumstances, and Pudge, a helpless cub who’s become soul-bonded to him, Zeke must keep collecting victories if he’s to survive in this merciless world. </p>

There were so many mysteries that I needed to unravel in order to get stronger and more capable. I did not know what the future held for me, but I was going to do everything in my power to push my limits and rise above it all.</p>

<p>That would be what anyone who knows me would say if they knew what I’ve done. They wouldn’t be wrong, as no sane person would ever quit his job the first chance he got when he saw an opening to follow his dream. To become rich and famous by playing video games. What? Did you think my dream wasn’t childish? The best dreams most often are. No? Well, maybe you just don’t dream big enough. Ever think about that?</p>
<p>Dreams are never easy to follow, and neither is mine. There are millions of players who want the same as I do, but very few would actually risk their future trying. Following the path of a Villain isn’t easy, and I have a city filled with thousands of players who would love to see me fail.</p>
<p>I will show them though. Just you wait and see...</p>

<p>Everyone Marcus knew is dead. His family is nothing more than a shared name, hospital bills sinking him deep in the red. He is shit out of luck.

<p>A young woman from Earth wakes up in a cave, disoriented, confused, amnesic and with her lower body replaced by that of a giant spider. She has no idea what she stumbled into and all the extra sensations were definitely not helping. ""Did I get reincarnated into a fantasy world?"" She's not quite sure. But, the goblin, the troll and (soon enough) the hot elf all suggest ""yes.""</p>
<p><br/>As much as it creeps her out, her new body is powerful and flexible in some very interesting 'spidery' ways as she slowly learns to live with it. Combined with what modern knowledge she can still remember, the newly christened Elania soon finds herself building a new life as an adventurer among the elves.</p>

<p>""Pallesia"" follows the story of Lee, a young man who died of cancer at 23. However, instead of passing into the ""nothing"" he thought was afterlife, Lee finds himself in a fantasy world filled with magic and mythical creatures.</p>
<p>As he navigates this new world, Lee discovers that he can create healing magic and decides to use his newfound powers to help those around him. Aiming to teach the world about his knowledge of healing, as well as the spells he has created, he will meet with a variety of fantasy races, and face many challenges. Monsters do not care about his noble goal, and there may be those who seek to use Lee's healing powers for their own. </p>
<p>Lee's adventures will take him to many new places, from bustling cities to treacherous wildernesses, as he faces the many challenges along the way.</p>

However, with an unknown biological father, after his mother, Isabella, rebelliously found a lover at a very young age, Alexander’s body was ‘tainted’ with a mysterious mana curse that prevented his body from absorbing mana. Despite countless attempts at dispelling the curse, nothing worked.</p>
<p>Years after Alexander’s birth, his mother managed to marry Duke Kallis out of love, and he’d become a strict but loving father that treats him the same as his step-siblings. Penelope and Eliot, children who lost their mother tragically to illness, now gained an unexpected brother who they only started accepting after the birth of their half-sister Elena. Their relationship was everything except normal, making even their conversations awkward at times. It didn’t help that Alexander was ridiculed by everyone outside the family for being the black sheep, a reputation that followed him throughout his life.</p>
<p>While his siblings proved to be generational talents, even among the strongest in the world, managing to form mana cores at an extremely young age, Alexander only dreamed of having magic. However, as fate would have it, Alexander’s future was bound to change when he met a mysterious individual who claimed he could help him.</p>

<p>With the last known bastion of The Fallen in ruins and the remaining Greater Devils isolated from civilization by thousands of miles and a monster-filled ocean, Evelyn and her crew set their course for Vigilance, hoping for rest and a chance to build a new life. But this victory has not come without a price. The memories of those she was forced to kill and the devastation she left behind weigh heavily on Evelyn's heart, casting a shadow over her every step.<br/> <br/>As she settles into her new role in society, navigating the complexities of studying, politics, and intrigue, the world begins to tip into chaos. Nations race against each other to reclaim the Fallen Lands, monsters surge back into the continent, and political tensions soar, forcing everyone to adapt to the new norms.</p>
<p>Evelyn isn't the only one caught up in these changes. The shockwaves of Aethabe's rage ripple across the continent, and as storms churn out of the shallow sea, the floodwaters filling Kingsgrove have an unexpected effect on a forgotten soul left behind.</p>",4.98,LitRPG;Portal Fantasy / Isekai;Progression;Comedy;Non-Human Lead;Action;Adventure;Fantasy;Reincarnation;Supernatural;Female Lead;Strong Lead;Secret Identity;Magic;GameLit;High Fantasy

<p>Hello everyone, this is going to be my first book and I’m very excited to write it. I had many ideas I want to write about for a long time but never wrote the out. I started reading JPN LN then got into all the Chinese LN so was influence by both types. I already read a few ln about being a dungeon/dungeon master and really enjoy and one day suddenly had an idea. What if a cultivator was to become a dungeon? A lot of these dungeon ln all have someone with modern world experience become the dungeon so they all have this advantage of games but what if someone who is straight out of a xianxia novel instead? Someone who has no idea how a more medieval fantasy world works and have no idea what a dungeon even is. This give me a lot of fun things to write about and finally decide to try writing it share it with you all! I hope you all enjoy it and please leave comments/review telling me how I can improve.</p>",4.4,Martial Arts;Slice of Life;Action;Adventure;Fantasy

<p>Fifteen years after Earth was forced into the Sarlenac Games, half the population is gone. Culled by the System without mercy. Each year, thousands of Gates open to hostile worlds—and if they aren't cleared in time, ten percent of Earth’s population is erased.</p>
<p>The System does not tolerate failure.</p>
<p>Specialist Jimmy Novak is a low-level combat medic—assigned the most basic healer class, with nothing to his name but scars, sarcasm, and a refusal to quit. But when a routine Gate spirals into catastrophe, and his entire platoon is slaughtered, Jimmy makes a choice the System never accounted for.</p>
<p>He’s seen by something <em>older</em> than the System. Something <em>forgotten</em>.</p>
<p><strong>[Skill Activated: Respec on Death]</strong><br/><strong>Class Reassigned. Attributes Redistributed. Fate Rewritten.</strong></p>
<p>With each death, Jimmy changes—new class, new build, new tools for survival. But the cost is steep, and the enemy is no longer just monsters or Gates. The System is watching. The gods are stirring.</p>
<p>And Jimmy Novak, once just a medic, is becoming something far more dangerous.</p>

<p>Author Note:<em> I tagged this story GameLit because it contains concepts like levels, classes, and dungeon/beast cores. But, it isn't tagged LitRPG because no one has status screens, other than occasionally Idea Seven who likes to organize data into blue boxes. It isn't a natural function of the world to display level ups or skill ups with an announcer voice. I mention this to set expectations, because otherwise I feel like LitRPG fans might be disappointed by my lack of LitRPG elements while others might be turned off thinking I have a lot of LitRPG elements. I think that if you approach the story with an open mind you will appreciate the gradual way in which the main character learns and expands his understanding of how the world works, but the game mechanics aren't meant to take center stage to the actual story.</em></p>",4.42,GameLit;Portal Fantasy / Isekai;Non-Human Lead;Sci-fi;Action;Adventure;Fantasy;Magic;High Fantasy

<p>Unfortunately, he's been summonsed there in the body of a golem, expected to work mindlessly to help cover the escape of a decimated Hussar regiment. Sam must quickly establish himself not as just any golem, but as Sergeant Golem. His mechanical skills and Army experience are just what the fugitives need to survive. As he helps form stragglers and survivors into a fighting unit, Sam starts to feel like he's found where he truly belongs.</p>
<p>Going up against enemy Russian mechs and mysterious magic-users would have been plenty, but then Baba Yaga sticks her withered nose into the mix. What's a simple golem to do?</p>

<p>What would you do if you found an ancient spaceship?</p>
<p>Michael Freeman is a disabled veteran who had just been fired from his mind-numbing cubicle job, which allowed his opportunistic girlfriend to dump him. Now, he only wants to spend some time in his grandfather's mountain cabin to unwind away from the drudgery of daily life with a cold beer in his hands.</p>
<p>Standing in his way is an ancient spaceship with an emotional AI, nanites that have invaded his body, an international crime syndicate, a suicidal FBI agent on a vigilante mission, terrorists... and this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>What can one man do when faced with insurmountable odds? Call it quits? Or… call some of his old army buddies and blow those obstacles to smithereens.</p>
<p>Can he become more than he had ever dreamed, reaching further than any man before? Staying under the radar of the powers that be while righting a few wrongs of the modern world.</p>
<p>He is sure of three things:</p>
<p>1. He really doesn’t want to follow the rules anymore... aside from his own.</p>
<p>2. Space is the ultimate frontier, and he had been given a turnkey technology to reach it—if they let him.</p>
<p>3. Those that want to hurt him and the people he cares about will rue the day they were born.</p>
<p>You do not always get what you wish for… sometimes, you get one hell of a lot more.</p>

Unfortunately, a royal decree asked for the top graduating student to be sent to the capital to serve as the new court wizard. Left with little choice, Jason took the job, reluctantly. As a commoner, he knew he'd be at a disadvantage in the politics driven royal court. Jason expected that his new job would test his wits as he'd have to struggle to fit in and keep himself out of trouble amidst all the intrigue. What he didn't expect was that the kingdom would quickly fall into crisis soon after he takes the post.</p>

<p>And then woke up as a young girl in a nation known as the Republic of Remus. She has a head full of patchwork and inconsistent knowledge, but she’s determined to use it to get a leg up on her second shot at life.</p>
<p>Ranthia is an Adventurer at heart, with a knack for getting herself into trouble. Fortunately, she's never met a problem she couldn't solve with a well-applied knife (if you ignore the myriad problems that couldn't be solved with a knife or that she really shouldn't have tried to solve with a knife). She might not be a [Paladin], but she does her best to embody the ideals of chaos and remains highly devoted to Xaoc. All while the beautiful Dragoneye Moons gaze down upon her.</p>

While I emphatically recommend you read the source material and experience Elaine’s journey, it’s not required to follow Ranthia’s own adventures.
