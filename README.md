# SocialNetworkAnalysis
University project for social network analysis

TODO:

ATTILA
- create 2 networks - one random, one scale-free

FOR EACH GRAPH

    HUNOR
    - provide a detailed description of the network: number of nodes, links, significance and meaning

    HUNOR
    - compute network properties: min/max/average degree, dimaeter, connected componenets and the size of the largest one, shortest paths,average clustering coefficient

    ATTILA
    - provide a visualization for the network

    MOZES
    - compute and plot: degree distribution, clustering coefficient distribution, betweenness centrality distribution, connected components size distribution

    MOZES
    - identify most important nodes according to different measures

HUNOR, MOZES, ATTILA
- what type of network is the selected real network
